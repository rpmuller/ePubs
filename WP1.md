# Preface

A few words of apology and explanation are called for if 
this book is to escape even more severe censure than it 
doubtless deserves. 

Apology is due to the specialists on various schools and individual
philosophers. With the possible exception of Leibniz, every
philosopher of whom I treat is better known to some others than to me.
If, however, books covering a Wide field are to be written at all, it
is inevitable, since we are not immortal, that those who write such
books should spend less time on any one part than can be spent by a
man who concentrates on a single author or a brief period. Some, whose
scholarly austerity is unbending, will conclude that books covering a
wide field should not be written at all, or, if written, should
consist of monographs by a multitude of authors. There is, however,
something lost when many authors cooperate. If there is any unity in
the movement of history, if there is any intimate relation between
what goes before and what comes later, it is necessary, for setting
this forth, that earlier and later periods should be synthesized in a
single mind. The student of Rousseau may have difficulty in doing
justice to his connection with the Sparta of Plato and Plutarch; the
historian of Sparta may not be prophetically conscious of Hobbes and
Fichte and Lenin. To bring out such relations is one of the purposes
of this book, and it is a purpose which only a wide survey can
fulfill.

There are many histories of philosophy, but none of them, so far as I
know, has quite the purpose that I have set myself. Philosophers are
both effects and causes: effects of their social circumstances and of
the politics and institutions of their time; causes (if they are
fortunate) of beliefs which mould the politics and institutions of
later ages. In most histories of philosophy, each philosopher appears
as in a vacuum; his opinions are set forth unrelated except, at most,
to those of earlier philosophers. I have tried, on the contrary, to
exhibit each philosopher, as far as truth permits, as an outcome of
his milieu, a man in whom were crystallized and concentrated thoughts
and feelings which, in a vague and diffused form, were common to the
community of which he was a part.

This has required the insertion of certain chapters of purely social
history. No one can understand the Stoics and Epicureans without some
knowledge of the Hellenistic age, or the scholastics without a modicum
of understanding of the growth of the Church from the fifth to the
thirteenth centuries. I have therefore set forth briefly those parts
of the main historical outlines that seemed to me to have had most
influence on philosophical thought, and I have done this with most
fulness where the history may be expected to be unfamiliar to some
readers for example, in regard to the early Middle Ages. But in these
historical chapters I have rigidly excluded whatever seemed to have
little or no bearing on contemporary or subsequent philosophy.

The problem of selection, in such a book as the present, is very
difficult. Without detail, a book becomes jejune and uninteresting;
with detail, it is in danger of becoming intolerably lengthy. I have
sought a compromise, by treating only those philosophers who seem to
me to have considerable importance, and mentioning, in connection with
them, such details as, even if not of fundamental importance, have
value on account of some illustrative or vivifying quality.

Philosophy, from the earliest times, has been not merely an affair of
the schools, or of disputation between a handful of learned men. It
has been an integral part of the life of the community, and as such I
have tried to consider it. If there is any merit in this book, it is
from this point of view that it is derived.

This book owes its existence to Dr. Albert C. Barnes, having 
been originally designed and partly delivered as lectures at the 
Barnes Foundation in Pennsylvania. 

As in most of my work during the years since 1932, I have 
been greatly assisted in research and in many other ways by my 
wife, Patricia Russell. 

# Introduction

The conceptions of life and the world which we call "philosophical"
are a product of two factors: one, inherited religious and ethical
conceptions; the other, the sort of investigation which may be called
"scientific," using this word in its broadest sense. Individual
philosophers have differed widely in regard to the proportions in
which these two factors entered into their systems, but it is the
presence of both, in some degree, that characterizes philosophy.

"Philosophy" is a word which has been used in many ways, some wider,
some narrower. I propose to use it in a very wide sense, which I will
now try to explain.

Philosophy, as I shall understand the word, is something intermediate
between theology and science. Like theology, it consists of
speculations on matters as to which definite knowledge has, so far,
been unascertainable; but like science, it appeals to human reason
rather than to authority, whether that of tradition or that of
revelation. All definite knowledge so I should contend belongs to
science; all dogma as to what surpasses definite knowledge belongs to
theology. But between theology and science there is a No Man's Land,
exposed to attack from both sides; this No Man's Land is philosophy.
Almost all the questions of most interest to speculative minds are
such as science cannot answer, and the confident answers of
theologians no longer seem so convincing as they did in former
centuries. Is the world divided into mind and matter, and, if so, what
is mind and what is matter? Is mind subject to matter, or is it
possessed of independent powers? Has the universe any unity or
purpose? Is it evolving towards some goal? Are there really laws of
nature, or do we believe in them only because of our innate love of
order? Is man what he seems to the astronomer, a tiny lump of impure
carbon and water impotently crawling on a small and unimportant
planet? Or is he what he appears to Hamlet? Is he perhaps both at
once? Is there a way of living that is noble and another that is base,
or are all ways of living merely futile? If there is a way of living
that is noble, in what does it consist, and how shall we achieve it?
Must the good be eternal in order to deserve to be valued, or is it
worth seeking even if the universe is inexorably moving toward death?

Is there such a thing as wisdom, or is what seems such merely the
ultimate refinement of folly? To such questions no answer can be found
in the laboratory. Theologies have professed to give answers, all too
definite; but their very definiteness causes modern minds to view them
with suspicion. The studying of these questions, if not the answering
of them, is the business of philosophy.

Why, then, you may ask, waste time on such insoluble problems? To this
one may answer as a historian, or as an individual facing the terror
of cosmic loneliness.

The answer of the historian, in so far as I am capable of giving it,
will appear in the course of this work. Ever since men became capable
of free speculation, their actions, in innumerable important respects,
have depended upon their theories as to the world and human life, as
to what is good and what is evil. This is as true in the present day
as at any former time. To understand an age or a nation, we must
understand its philosophy, and to understand its philosophy we must
ourselves be in some degree philosophers. There is here a reciprocal
causation: the circumstances of men's lives do much to determine their
philosophy, but, conversely, their philosophy does much to determine
their circumstances. This interaction throughout the centuries will be
the topic of the following pages.

There is also, however, a more personal answer. Science tells us what
we can know, but what we can know is little, and if we forget how much
we cannot know we become insensitive to many things of very great
importance. Theology, on the other hand, induces a dogmatic belief
that we have knowledge where in fact we have ignorance, and by doing
so generates a kind of impertinent insolence towards the universe.
Uncertainty, in the presence of vivid hopes and fears, is painful, but
must be endured if we wish to live without the support of comforting
fairy tales. It is not good either to forget the questions that
philosophy asks, or to persuade ourselves that we have found
indubitable answers to them. To teach how to live without certainty,
and yet without being paralyzed by hesitation, is perhaps the chief
thing that philosophy, in our age, can still do for those who study
it.

Philosophy as distinct from theology, began in Greece in the 
sixth century BC. After running its course in antiquity, it was 
again submerged by theology as Christianity rose and Rome fell. 

Its second great period, from the eleventh to the fourteenth
centuries, was dominated by the Catholic Church, except for a few
great rebels, such as the Emperor Frederick II (1195--1250). This
period was brought to an end by the confusions that culminated in the
Reformation. The third period, from the seventeenth century to the
present day, is dominated, more than either of its predecessors, by
science; traditional religious beliefs remain important, but are felt
to need justification, and are modified wherever science seems to make
this imperative. Few of the philosophers of this period are orthodox
from a Catholic standpoint, and the secular State is more important in
their speculations than the Church.

Social cohesion and individual liberty, like religion and science, are
in a state of conflict or uneasy compromise throughout the whole
period. In Greece, social cohesion was secured by loyalty to the City
State; even Aristotle, though in his time Alexander was making the
City State obsolete, could see no merit in any other kind of
polity. The degree to which the individual's liberty was curtailed by
his duty to the City varied widely. In Sparta he had as little liberty
as in modern Germany or Russia; in Athens, in spite of occasional
persecutions, citizens had, in the best period, a very extraordinary
freedom from restrictions imposed by the State. Greek thought down to
Aristotle is dominated by religious and patriotic devotion to the City
; its ethical systems arc adapted to the lives of citizens and have a
large political element. When the Greeks became subject, first to the
Macedonians, and then to the Romans, the conceptions appropriate to
their days of independence were no longer applicable. This produced,
on the one hand, a loss of vigor through the breach with tradition,
and, on the other hand, a more individual and less social ethic. The
Stoics thought of the virtuous life as a relation of the soul to God,
rather than as a relation of the citizen to the State. They thus
prepared the way for Christianity, which, like Stoicism, was
originally unpolitical, since, during its first three centuries, its
adherents were devoid of influence on government. Social cohesion,
during the six and a half centuries from Alexander to Constantine, was
secured, not by philosophy and not by ancient loyalties, but by force,
first that of armies and then that of civil administration.  Roman
armies, Roman roads, Roman law, and Roman officials first created and
then preserved a powerful centralized State.

Nothing was attributable to Roman philosophy, since there was none.

During this long period, the Greek ideas inherited from the age of
freedom underwent a gradual process of transformation. Some of the old
ideas, notably those which we should regard as specifically religious,
gained in relative importance; others, more rationalistic, were
discarded because they no longer suited the spirit of the age. In this
way the later pagans trimmed the Greek tradition until it became
suitable for incorporation in Christian doctrine.

Christianity popularized an important opinion, already implicit in the
teaching of the Stoics, but foreign to the general spirit of antiquity
I mean, the opinion that a man's duty to God is more imperative than
his duty to the State.[^1a] This opinion that "we ought to obey God
rather than Man" as Socrates and the Apostles said survived the
conversion of Constantine, because the early Christian emperors were
Arians or inclined to Arianism. When the emperors became orthodox, it
fell into abeyance. In the Byzantine Empire it remained latent, as
also in the subsequent Russian Empire, which derived its Christianity
from Constantinople.[^2a] But in the West, where the Catholic emperors
were almost immediately replaced (except in parts of Gaul) by
heretical barbarian conquerors, the superiority of religious to
political allegiance survived, and to some extent still survives.

[^1a]: This opinion was not unknown in earlier times: it is stated, for 
example, in the Antigone of Sophocles. But before the Stoics those who 
held it were few. 

[^2a]: That is why the modern Russian does not think that we ought to 
obey dialectical materialism rather than Stalin. 

The barbarian invasion put an end, for six centuries, to the 
civilization of western Europe. It lingered in Ireland until the 
Danes destroyed it in the ninth century; before its extinction 
there it produced one notable figure, Scotus Erigena. In the 
Eastern Empire, Greek civilization, in a desiccated form, survived, 
as in a museum, till the fall of Constantinople in 1453, but nothing 
of importance to the world came out of Constantinople except an 
artistic tradition and Justinian's Codes of Roman law. 

During the period of darkness, from the end of the fifth century to
the middle of the eleventh, the western Roman world underwent some
very interesting changes. The conflict between duty to God and duty to
the State, which Christianity had introduced, took the form of a
conflict between Church and king. The ecclesiastical jurisdiction of
the Pope extended over Italy, France, and Spain, Great Britain and
Ireland, Germany, Scandinavia, and Poland. At first, outside Italy and
southern France, his control over bishops and abbots was very slight,
but from the time of Gregory VII (late eleventh century) it became
real and effective.  From that time on, the clergy, throughout western
Europe, formed a single organization directed from Rome, seeking power
intelligently and relentlessly, and usually victorious, until after
the year 1300, in their conflicts with secular rulers. The conflict
between Church and State was not only a conflict between clergy and
laity; it was also a renewal of the conflict between the
Mediterranean world and the northern barbarians. The unity of the
Church echoed the unity of the Roman Empire; its liturgy was Latin,
and its dominant men were mostly Italian, Spanish, or southern
French. Their education, when education revived, was classical; their
conceptions of law and government would have been more intelligible to
Marcus Aurelius than they were to contemporary monarchs. The Church
represented at once continuity with the past and what was most
civilized in the present.

The secular power, on the contrary, was in the hands of kings and
barons of Teutonic descent, who endeavored to preserve what they
could of the institutions that they had brought out of the forests of
Germany. Absolute power was alien to those institutions, and so was
what appeared to these vigorous conquerors as a dull and spiritless
legality. The king had to share his power with the feudal aristocracy,
but all alike expected to be allowed occasional outbursts of passion
in the form of war, murder, pillage, or rape. Monarchs might repent,
for they were sincerely pious, and, after all, repentance was itself a
form of passion. But the Church could never produce in them the quiet
regularity of good behavior which a'modern employer demands, and
usually obtains, of his employees. What was the use of conquering the
world if they could not drink and murder and love as the spirit moved
them? And why should they, with their armies of proud knights, submit
to the orders of bookish men, vowed to celibacy and destitute of armed
force? In spite of ecclesiastic disapproval, they preserved the duel
and trial by battle, and they developed tournaments and courtly
love. Occasionally, in a fit of rage, they would even murder eminent
churchmen.

All the armed force was on the side of the kings, and yet the Church
was victorious. The Church won, partly because it had almost a
monopoly of education, partly because the kings were perpetually at
war with each other, but mainly because, with very few exceptions,
rulers and people alike profoundly believed that the Church possessed
the power of the keys. The Church could decide whether a king should
spend eternity in heaven or in hell; the Church could absolve
subjects from the duty of allegiance, and so stimulate rebellion. The
Church, moreover, represented order in place of anarchy, and
consequently won the support of the rising mercantile class. In Italy,
especially, this last consideration was decisive.

The Teutonic attempt to preserve at least a partial independence of
the Church expressed itself not only in politics, but also in art,
romance, chivalry, and war. It expressed itself very little in the
intellectual world, because education was almost wholly confined to
the clergy. The explicit philosophy of the Middle Ages is not an
accurate mirror of the times, but only of what was thought by one
party. Among ecclesiastics, however especially among the Franciscan
friars a certain number, for various reasons, were at variance with
the Pope. In Italy, moreover, culture spread to the laity some
centuries sooner than it did north of the Alps. Frederick II, who
tried to found a new religion, represents the extreme of anti-papal
culture; Thomas Aquinas, who was born in the kingdom of Naples where
Frederick II was supreme, remains to this day the classic exponent of
papal philosophy. Dante, some fifty years later, achieved a synthesis,
and gave the only balanced exposition of the complete medieval world
of ideas.

After Dante, both for political and for intellectual reasons, the
medieval philosophical synthesis broke down. It had, while it lasted,
a quality of tidiness and miniature completeness; whatever the system
took account of was placed with precision with relation to the other
contents of its very finite cosmos. But the Great Schism, die
conciliar movement, and the Renaissance papacy led up to the
Reformation, which destroyed the unity of Christendom and the
scholastic theory of government that centered round the
Pope. In the Renaissance period new knowledge, both of antiquity 
and of the earth's surface, made men tired of systems, which were 
felt to be mental prisons. The Copernican astronomy assigned to 
the earth and to man a humbler position than they had enjoyed 
in the Ptolemaic theory. Pleasure in new facts took the place, 
among intelligent men, of pleasure in reasoning, analyzing, and 
systematizing. Although in art the Renaissance is still orderly, in 
thought it prefers a large and fruitful disorder. In this respect, 
Montaigne is the most typical exponent of the age. 

In the theory of politics, as in everything except art, there was a
collapse of order. The Middle Ages, though turbulent in practice, were
dominated in thought by a passion for legality and by a very precise
theory of political power. All power is ultimately from God; He has
delegated power to the Pope in sacred things and to the Emperor in
secular matters. But Pope and Emperor alike lost their importance
during the fifteenth century. The Pope became merely one of the
Italian princes, engaged in the incredibly complicated and
unscrupulous game of Italian power politics.  The new national
monarchies in France, Spain, and England had, in their own
territories, a power with which neither Pope nor Emperor could
interfere. The national State, largely owing to gunpowder, acquired an
influence over men's thoughts and feelings which it had not had
before, and which progressively destroyed what remained of the Roman
belief in the unity of civilization.

This political disorder found expression in Machiavelli's _Prince_.  In
the absence of any guiding principle, politics becomes a naked
struggle for power; The Prince gives shrewd advice as to how to play
this game successfully. What had happened in die great age of Greece
happened again in Renaissance Italy: traditional moral restraints
disappeared, because they were seen to be associated with
superstition; the liberation from fetters made individuals energetic
and creative, producing a rare florescence of genius; but the anarchy
and treachery which inevitably resulted from the decay of morals made
Italians collectively impotent, and they fell, like the Greeks, under
the domination of nations less civilized than themselves but not so
destitute of social cohesion.

The result, however, was less disastrous than in the case of 
Greece, because the newly powerful nations, with the exception 
of Spain, showed themselves as capable of great achievement as 
the Italians had been. 

From the sixteenth century onward, the history of European 
thought is dominated by the Reformation. The Reformation was 
a complex many-sided movement, and owed its success to a 
variety of causes. In the main, it was a revolt of the northern 
nations against the renewed dominion of Rome. Religion was the 
force that had subdued the North, but religion in Italy had 
decayed: the papacy remained as an institution, and extracted a 
huge tribute from Germany and England, but these nations, 
which were still pious, could feel no reverence for the Borgias and 
Medicis, who professed to save souls from purgatory in return for 
cash which they squandered on luxury and immorality. National 
motives, economic motives, and moral motives all combined to 
strengthen the revolt against Rome. Moreover the Princes soon 
perceived that, if the Church in their territories became merely 
national, they would be able to dominate it, and would thus 
become much more powerful at home than they had been while 
sharing dominion with the Pope. For all these reasons, Luther's 
theological innovations were welcomed by rulers and peoples alike 
throughout the greater part of northern Europe. 

The Catholic Church was derived from three sources. Its sacred history
was Jewish, its theology was Greek, its government and canon law were,
at least indirectly, Roman. The Reformation rejected the Roman
elements, softened the Greek elements, and greatly strengthened the
Judaic elements. It thus cooperated with the nationalist forces which
were undoing the work of social cohesion which had been effected first
by the Roman Empire and then by the Roman Church. In Catholic
doctrine, divine revelation did not end with the scriptures, but
continued from age to age through the medium of the Church, to which,
therefore, it was the duty of the individual to submit his private
opinions. Protestants, on the contrary, rejected the Church as a
vehicle of revelation; truth was to be sought only in the Bible,
which each man could interpret for himself. If men differed in their
interpretation, there was no divinely appointed authority to decide
the dispute. In practice, the State claimed the right that had
formerly belonged to the Church, but this was a usurpation. In
Protestant theory, there should be no earthly intermediary between the
soul and God.

The effects of this change were momentous. Truth was no longer to be
ascertained by consulting authority, but by inward meditation, There
was a tendency, quickly developed, towards anarchism in politics, and,
in religion, towards mysticism, which had always fitted with
difficulty into the framework of Catholic orthodoxy. There came to be
not one Protestantism, but a multitude of sects; not one philosophy
opposed to scholasticism, but as many as there were philosophers;
not, as in the thirteenth century, one Emperor opposed to the Pope,
but a large number of heretical kings. The result, in thought as in
literature, was a continually deepening subjectivism, operating at
first as a wholesome liberation from spiritual slavery, but advancing
steadily towards a personal isolation inimical to social sanity.

Modern philosophy begins with Descartes, whose fundamental 
certainty is the existence of himself and his thoughts, from which 
the external world is to be inferred. This was only the first stage 
in a development, through Berkeley and Kant, to Fichte, for whom 
everything is only an emanation of the ego. This was insanity, and, 
from this extreme, philosophy has been attempting, ever since, to 
escape into the world of everyday common sense. 

With subjectivism in philosophy, anarchism in politics goes hand in
hand. Already during Luther's lifetime, unwelcome and unacknowledged
disciples had developed the doctrine of Anabaptism, which, for a time,
dominated the city of Munster. The Anabaptists repudiated all law,
since they held that the good man will be guided at every moment by
the Holy Spirit, who cannot be bound by formulas. From this premiss
they arrive at communism and sexual promiscuity; they were therefore
exterminated after a heroic resistance. But their doctrine, in
softened forms, spread to Holland, England and America; historically,
it is the source of Quakerism. A fiercer form of anarchism, no longer
connected with religion, arose in the nineteenth century. In Russia,
in Spain, and to a lesser degree in Italy, it had considerable
success, and to this day it remains a bugbear of the American
immigration authorities. This modern form, though anti-religious, has
still much of the spirit of early Protestantism; it differs mainly in
directing against secular governments the hostility that Luther
directed against popes.

Subjectivity, once let loose, could not be confined within limits
until it had run its course. In morals, the Protestant emphasis on the
individual conscience was essentially anarchic. Habit and custom were
so strong that, except in occasional outbreaks such as that of
Munster, the disciples of individualism in ethics continued to act in
a manner which was conventionally virtuous. But this was a precarious
equilibrium. The eighteenth-century cult of "sensibility" began to
break it down: an act was admired, not for its good consequences, or
for its conformity to a moral code, but for die emotion that inspired
it. Out of this attitude developed the cult of the hero, as it is
expressed by Carlyle and Nietzsche, and the Byronic cult of violent
passion of no matter what kind.

The romantic movement, in art, in literature, and in politics, is
hound up with this subjective way of judging men, not as members of a
community, but as aesthetically delightful objects of
contemplation. Tigers are more beautiful than sheep, but we prefer
them behind bars. The typical romantic removes the bars and enjoys the
magnificent leaps with which the tiger annihilates the sheep. He
exhorts men to imagine themselves tigers, and when he succeeds the
results are not wholly pleasant.

Against the more insane forms of subjectivism in modern times there
have been various reactions. First, a half-way compromise philosophy,
the doctrine of liberalism, which attempted to assign the respective
spheres of government and the individual. This begins, in its modern
form, with Locke, who is as much opposed to "enthusiasm" the
individualism of the Anabaptists as to absolute authority and blind
subservience to tradition. A more thoroughgoing revolt leads to the
doctrine of State worship, which assigns to the State the position
that Catholicism gave to the Church, or even, sometimes, to
God. Hobbes, Rousseau, and Hegel represent different phases of this
theory, and their doctrines are embodied practically in Cromwell,
Napoleon, and modern Germany. Communism, in theory, is far removed
from such philosophies, but is driven, in practice, to a type of
community very similar to that which results from State worship.

Throughout this long development, from 600 BC to the present day,
philosophers have been divided into those who wished to tighten social
bonds and those who wished to relax them. With this difference others
have been associated. The disciplinarians have advocated some system
of dogma, either old or new, and have therefore been compelled to be,
in a greater or less degree, hostile to science, since their dogmas
could not be proved empirically. They have almost invariably taught
that happiness is not the good, but that "nobility" or "heroism" is to
be preferred.  they have had a sympathy with the irrational parts of
human nature, since they have felt reason to be inimical to social
cohesion.  The libertarians, on the other hand, with the exception of
the extreme anarchists, have tended to be scientific, utilitarian,
rationalistic, hostile to violent passion, and enemies of all the more
profound forms of religion. This conflict existed in Greece before the
rise of what we recognize as philosophy, and is already quite explicit
in the earliest Greek thought. In changing forms, it has persisted
down to the present day, and no doubt will persist for many ages to
come.

It is clear that each party to this dispute as to all that persist
through long periods of time is partly right and partly wrong.  Social
cohesion is a necessity, and mankind has never yet succeeded in
enforcing cohesion by merely rational arguments. Every community is
exposed to two opposite dangers; ossification through too much
discipline and reverence for tradition, on the one hand; on the other
hand, dissolution, or subjection to foreign conquest, through the
growth of an individualism and personal independence that makes
co-operation impossible. In general, important civilizations start
with a rigid and superstitious system, gradually relaxed, and leading,
at a certain stage, to a period of brilliant genius, while the good of
the old tradition remains and the evil inherent in its dissolution has
not yet developed. But as the evil unfolds, it leads to anarchy,
thence, inevitably, to a new tyranny, producing a new synthesis
secured by a new system of dogma.  The doctrine of liberalism is an
attempt to escape from this endless oscillation. The essence of
liberalism is an attempt to secure a social order not based on
irrational dogma, and insuring stability without involving more
restraints than are necessary for the preservation of the
community. Whether this attempt can succeed only the future can
determine.

# Book One ANCIENT PHILOSOPHY 

# Part 1. The Pre-Socratics 

## Chapter I THE RISE OF GREEK CIVILIZATION 

In all history, nothing is so surprising or so difficult to account 
for as the sudden rise of civilization in Greece. Much of what 
makes civilization had already existed for thousands of years in 
Egypt and in Mesopotamia, and had spread thence to neighboring 
countries. But certain elements had been lacking until the Greeks 
supplied them. What they achieved in art and literature is familiar 
to even-body, but what they did in the purely intellectual realm 
is even more exceptional. They invented mathematics[^1] and 
science and philosophy; they first wrote history as opposed to 
mere annals; they speculated freely about the nature of the world 
and the ends of life, without being bound in the fetters of any 
inherited orthodoxy. What occurred was so astonishing that, until 
very recent times, men were content to gape and talk mystically 
about the Greek genius. It is possible, however, to understand 
the development of Greece in scientific terms, and it is well worth 
while to do so. 

[^1]: Arithmetic and some geometry existed among the Egyptians and 
Babylonians, but mainly in the form of rules of thumb. Deductive 
reasoning from general premisses was a Greek innovation. 

Philosophy begins with Thales, who, fortunately, can be dated by the
fact that he predicted an eclipse which, according to the astronomers,
occurred in the year 585 BC Philosophy and science---which were not
originally separate---were therefore born together at the beginning of
the sixth century. What had been happening in Greece and neighboring
countries before this lime? Any answer must be in part conjectural,
but archaeology, during the present century, has given us much more
knowledge than was possessed by our grandfathers.

The art of writing was invented in Egypt about the year 
4000 BC, and in Mesopotamia not much later. In each country 
writing began with pictures of the objects intended. These 
pictures quickly became conventionalized, so that words were 
represented by ideograms, as they still are in China. In the course 
of thousands of years, this cumbrous system developed into 
alphabetic writing. 

The early development of civilization in Egypt and Mesopotamia was due
to the Nile, the Tigris, and the Euphrates, which made agriculture
very easy and very productive. The civilization was in many ways
similar to that which the Spaniards found in Mexico and Peru. There
was a divine king, with despotic powers; in Egypt, he owned all the
land. There was a polytheistic religion, with a supreme god to whom
the king had a specially intimate relation. There was a military
aristocracy, and also a priestly aristocracy. The latter was often
able to encroach on the royal power, if the king was weak or if he was
engaged in a difficult war. The cultivators of the soil were serfs,
belonging to the king, the aristocracy, or the priesthood.

There was a considerable difference between Egyptian and 
Babylonian theology. The Egyptians were preoccupied with 
death, and believed that the souls of the dead descend into the 
underworld, where they are judged by Osiris according to the 
manner of their life on earth. They thought that the soul would 
ultimately return to the body; this led to mummification and 
to the construction of splendid tombs. The pyramids were built 
by various kings at the end of the fourth millennium BC and 
the beginning of the third. After this time, Egyptian civilization 
became more and more stereotyped, and religious conservatism 
made progress impossible. About 1800 BC Egypt was conquered 
by Semites named Hyksos, who ruled the country for about 
two centuries. They left no permanent mark on Epypt, but their 
presence there must have helped to spread Egyptian civilization 
in Syria and Palestine. 

Babylonia had a more warlike development than Egypt. At first, the
ruling race were not Semites, but "Sumerians," whose origin is
unknown. They invented cuneiform writing, which the conquering Semites
took over from them. There was a period when there were various
independent cities which fought with each other, but in the end
Babylon became supreme and established an empire. The gods of other
cities became subordinate, and Marduk, the god of Babylon, acquired a
position like that later held by Zeus in the Greek pantheon. The same
sort of thing had happened in Egypt, but at a much earlier time.

The religions of Egypt and Babylonia, like other ancient religions,
were originally fertility cults. The earth was female, the sun
male. The bull was usually regarded as an embodiment of male
fertility, and bull-gods were common. In Babylon, Ishtar, the
earth-goddess, was supreme among female divinities.  Throughout
western Asia, the Great Mother was worshipped under various
names. When Greek colonists in Asia Minor found temples to her, they
named her Artemis and took over the existing cult. This is the origin
of "Diana of the Ephesians."[^2] Christianity transformed her into the
Virgin Mary, and it was a Council at Ephesus that legitimated the
title "Mother of God" as applied to Our Lady.

[^2]: Diana was the Latin equivalent of Artemis. It is Artemis who is mentioned in the Greek Testament where our translation speaks of Diana.

Where a religion was bound up with the government of an empire,
political motives did much to transform its primitive features. A god
or goddess became associated with the State, and had to give, not only
an abundant harvest, but victory in war.  A rich priestly caste
elaborated the ritual and the theology, and fitted together into a
pantheon the several divinities of the component parts of the empire.

Through association with government, the gods also became 
associated with morality. Lawgivers received their codes from a 
god; thus a breach of the law became an impiety. The oldest 
legal code still known is that of Hammurabi, king of Babylon, 
about 2100 BC; this code was asserted by the king to have been 
delivered to him by Marduk. The connection between religion 
and morality became continually closer throughout ancient times. 

Babylonian religion, unlike that of Egypt, was more concerned with
prosperity in this world than with happiness in the next.  Magic,
divination, and astrology, though not peculiar to Babylonia, were more
developed there than elsewhere, and it was chiefly through Babylon
that they acquired their hold on later antiquity. From Babylon come
some things that belong to science: the division of the day into
twenty-four hours, and of the circle into 360 degrees; also the
discovery of a cycle in eclipses, which enabled lunar eclipses to be
predicted with certainty, and solar eclipses with some
probability. This Babylonian knowledge, as we shall see, was acquired
by Thales.

The civilizations of Egypt and Mesopotamia were agricultural, and
those of surrounding nations, at first, were pastoral. A new element
came with the development of commerce, which was at first almost
entirely maritime. Weapons, until about 1000 BC, were made of
bronze, and nations which did not have the necessary metals on their
own territory were obliged to obtain them by trade or piracy. Piracy
was a temporary expedient, and where social and political conditions
were fairly stable, commerce was found to be more profitable. In
commerce, the island of Crete seems to have been the pioneer. For
about eleven centuries, say from 2500 BC to 1400 BC, an
artistically advanced culture, called the Minoan, existed in
Crete. What survives of Cretan art gives an impression of cheerfulness
and almost decadent luxury, very different from the terrifying gloom
of Egyptian temples.

Of this important civilization almost nothing was known until the
excavations of Sir Arthur Evans and others. It was a maritime
civilization, in close touch with Egypt (except during the time of the
Hyksos). From Egyptian pictures it is evident that the very
considerable commerce between Egypt and Crete was carried on by Cretan
sailors; this commerce reached its maximum about 1500 BC. The Cretan
religion appears to have had some affinities with the religions of
Syria and Asia Minor, but in art there was more affinity with Egypt,
though Cretan art was very original and amazingly full of life. The
center of the Cretan civilization was the so-called "palace of
Minos"at Knossos,of which memories lingered in the traditions of
classical Greece. The palaces of Crete were very magnificent, but were
destroyed about the end of the fourteenth century BC, probably by
invaders from Greece. The chronology of Cretan history is derived from
Egyptian objects found in Crete, and Cretan objects found in Egypt;
throughout, our knowledge is dependent on archaeological evidence.

The Cretans worshipped a goddess, or perhaps several goddesses. 
The most indubitable goddess was the "Mistress of Animals," 
who was a huntress, and probably the source of the classical 
Artemis.[^3] She apparently was also a mother; the only male deity, 
apart from the "Master of Animals," is her young son. There is 
some evidence of belief in an after life, in which, as in Egyptian 
belief, deeds on earth receive reward or retribution. But on the 
whole the Cretans appear, from their art, to have been cheerful 
people, not much oppressed by gloomy superstitions. They were 
fond of bull-fights, at which female as well as male toreadors 
performed amazing acrobatic feats. Sir Arthur Evans thinks that 
the bull-fights were religious celebrations, and that the performers 
belonged to the highest nobility, but this view is not generally 
accepted. The surviving pictures are full of movement and realism. 

[^3]: She has a male twin or consort, the "Master of Animals" but he is
less prominent. It was at a later date that Artemis was identified
with the Great Mother of Asia Minor.

The Cretans had a linear script, but it has not been deciphered. 
At home they were peaceful, and their cities were un walled; 
no doubt they were defended by sea power. 

Before the destruction of the Minoan culture, it spread, about 
1600 BC, to the mainland of Greece, where it survived, through 
gradual stages of modification, until about 900 BC. This mainland 
civilization is called the Mycenaean; it is known through the 
tombs of kings, and also through fortresses on hill-tops, which 
show more fear of war than had existed in Crete. Both tombs 
and fortresses remained to impress the imagination of classical 
Greece. The older art products in the palaces are either actually 
of Cretan workmanship, or closely akin to those of Crete. The 
Mycenaean civilization, seen through a haze of legend, is that 
which is depicted in Homer. 

There is much uncertainty concerning the Mycenaeans. Did they owe
their civilization to being conquered by the Cretans?  Did they speak
Greek, or were they an earlier indigenous race?  No certain answer to
these questions is possible, but there is evidence which makes it
probable that they were conquerors who spoke Greek, and that at least
the aristocracy consisted of fair-haired invaders from the North, who
brought the Greek language with them.[^4] The Greeks came to Greece in
three successive waves, first the Ionians, then the Achaeans, and last
the Dorians. The Ionians appear, though conquerors, to have adopted
the Cretan civilization pretty completely, as, later, the Romans
adopted the civilization of Greece. But the Ionians were disturbed,
and largely dispossessed, by their successors, the Achaeans. The
Achaeans are known, from the Hittite tablets found at Boghaz-Keui, to
have had a large organized empire in the fourteenth century BC. The
Mycenaean civilization, which had been weakened by the warfare of the
Ionians and Achaeans, was practically destroyed by the Dorians, the
last Greek invaders. Whereas previous invaders had largely adopted the
Minoan religion, the Dorians retained the original Indo-European
religion of their ancestors. The religion of Mycenaean times, however,
lingered on, especially in the lower classes, and the religion of
classical Greece was a blend of the two. In fact some of the classical
goddesses were of Mycenaean origin.

[^4]: See The Minoan-Myceaean Religion and Its Survival in Greek 
Religion, by Martin P. Nilsson. p. 11 ff.

Although the above account seems probable, it must be remembered that
we do not know whether the Mycenaeans were Greeks or not. What we do
know is that their civilization decayed, that about the time when it
ended iron superseded bronze, and that for some time sea supremacy
passed to the Phoenicians.

Both during the later part of the Mycenaean age and after its 
end, some of the invaders settled down and became agriculturists, 
while some pushed on, first into the islands and Asia Minor, 
then into Sicily and southern Italy, where they founded cities 
that lived by maritime commerce. It was in these maritime cities 
that the Greeks first made qualitatively new contributions to 
civilization; the supremacy of Athens came later, and was equally 
associated, when it came, with naval power. 

The mainland of Greece is mountainous and largely infertile. 
There are, however, many fertile valleys, with easy access to the 
sea, but cut off by the mountains from easy land communication 
with each other. In these valleys little separate communities grew 
up, living by agriculture, and centering round a town, generally 
close to the sea. In such circumstances it was natural that, as 
soon as the population of any community grew too great for its 
internal resources, those who could not live on the land should 
take to seafaring. The cities of the mainland founded colonies, 
often in places where it was much easier to find subsistence than 
it had been at home. Thus in the earliest historical period the 
Greeks of Asia Minor, Sicily, and Italy were much richer than 
those of the Greek mainland. 

The social system was very different in different parts of Greece. In
Sparta, a small aristocracy subsisted on the labour of oppressed serfs
of a different race; in the poorer agricultural regions, the
population consisted mainly of fanners cultivating their own land with
the help of their families. But where commerce and industry
flourished, the free citizens grew rich by the employment of slaves
male in the mines, female in the textile industry. These slaves were,
in Ionia, of the surrounding barbarian population, and were, as a
rule, first acquired in war.  With increasing wealth went increasing
isolation of respectable women, who in later times had little part in
the civilized aspects of Greek life except in Sparta and Lesbos.

There was a very general development, first from monarchy to
aristocracy, then to an alternation of tyranny and democracy.  The
kings were not absolute, like those of Egypt and Babylonia; they were
advised by a Council of Elders, and could not transgress custom with
impunity. "Tyranny" did not mean necessarily bad government, but only
the rule of a man whose claim to power was not hereditary. "Democracy"
meant government by all the citizens, among whom slaves and women were
not included. The early tyrants, like the Medici, acquired their power
through being the richest members of their respective
plutocracies. Often the source of their wealth was the ownership of
gold and silver mines, made the more profitable by the new institution
of coinage, which came from the kingdom of Lydia, adjacent to
Ionia.[^5] Coinage seems to have been invented shortly before 700 BC

[^5]: See P. N. Ure, _The Origin of Tyranny_.

One of the most important results, to the Greeks, of commerce or
piracy at first the two are scarcely distinct was the acquisition of
the art of writing. Although writing had existed for thousands of
years in Egypt and Babylonia, and the Minoan Cretans had a script
(which has not been deciphered), there is no conclusive evidence that
the Greeks acquired alphabetic writing until about the tenth century
BC. They learnt the art from the Phoenicians, who, like the other
inhabitants of Syria, were exposed to both Egyptian and Babylonian
influences, and who held the supremacy in maritime commerce until the
rise of the Greek cities of Ionia, Italy, and Sicily. In the
fourteenth century, writing to Ikhnaton (the heretic king of Egypt),
Syrians still used the Babylonian cuneiform; but Hiram of Tyre
(969--936) used the Phoenician alphabet, which probably developed out
of the Egyptian script. The Egyptians used, at first, a pure picture
writing; gradually the pictures, much conventionalized, came to
represent syllables (the first syllables of the names of the things
pictured), and at last single letters, on the principle of "A was an
Archer who shot at a frog."[^6] This last step, which was not taken
with any completeness by the Egyptians themselves, but by the
Phoenicians, gave the alphabet with all its advantages.  The Greeks,
borrowing from the Phoenicians, altered the alphabet to suit their
language, and made the important innovation of adding vowels instead
of having only consonants. There can be no doubt that the acquisition
of this convenient method of writing greatly hastened the rise of
Greek civilization.

[^6]: For instance, "Gimel," the third letter of the Hebrew alphabet, 
means "camel," and the sign for it is a conventionalized picture of a 
camel. 

The first notable product of the Hellenic civilization was
Homer. Even-thing about Homer is conjectural, but there is a widely
held opinion that he was a series of poets rather than an
individual. According to those who hold this opinion, the Iliad and
the Odyssey between them took about two hundred years to complete,
some say from 750 to 550 BC,[^7] while others hold that "Homer" was
nearly complete at the end of the eighth century.[^8] The Homeric
poems, in their present form, were brought to Athens by Peisistratus,
who reigned (with intermissions) from 560 to 527 BC From his time
onward, the Athenian youth learnt Homer by heart, and this was the
most important part of their education. In some parts of Greece,
notably in Sparta, Homer had not the same prestige until a later date.

[^7]: Beloch, _Griechische Geschiechte_, chap. xii. 
[^8]: Rostovtstefs, _History of the Ancient World_, Vol. I. p. 390.

The Homeric poems, like the courtly romances of the later 
Middle Ages, represent the point of view of a civilized aristocracy, 
which ignores as plebeian various superstitions that arc still 
rampant among the populace. In much later times, many of these 
superstitions rose again to the light of day. Guided by anthropology, 
many modern writers have come to the conclusion that Homer, 
so far from being primitive, was an expurgator, a kind of eighteenth 
century rationalizer of ancient myths, holding up an upper-class
ideal of urbane enlightenment. The Olympian gods, who represent 
religion in Homer, were not the only objects of worship among the 
Greeks, either in his time or later. There were other darker and 
more savage elements in popular religion, which were kept at 
bay by the Greek intellect at its best, but lay in wait to pounce 
in moments of weakness or terror. In the time of decadence, 
beliefs which Homer had discarded proved to have persisted, 
half buried, throughout the classical period. This fact explains 
many things that would otherwise seem inconsistent and surprising. 


Primitive religion, everywhere, was tribal rather than personal.
Certain rites were performed, which were intended, by sympathetic
magic, to further the interests of the tribe, especially in respect of
fertility, vegetable, animal, and human. The winter solstice was a
time when the sun had to be encouraged not to go on diminishing in
strength; spring and harvest also called for appropriate
ceremonies. These were often such as to generate a great collective
excitement, in which individuals lost their sense of separateness and
felt themselves at one with the whole tribe. All over the world, at a
certain stage of religious evolution, sacred animals and human beings
were ceremonially killed and eaten. In different regions, this stage
occurred at very different dates. Human sacrifice usually lasted
longer than the sacrificial eating of human victims; in Greece it was
not yet extinct at the beginning of historical times. Fertility rites
without such cruel aspects were common throughout Greece; the
Eleusinian mysteries, in particular, were essentially agricultural in
their symbolism.

It must he admitted that religion, in Homer, is not very religious.
The gods are completely human, differing from men only in being
immortal and possessed of superhuman powers. Morally, there is nothing
to be said for them, and it is difficult to see how they can have
inspired much awe. In some passages, supposed to be late, they are
treated with Voltairean irreverence. Such genuine religious feeling as
is to be found in Homer is less concerned with the gods of Olympus
than with more shadowy beings such as Fate or Necessity or Destiny, to
whom even Zeus is subject. Fate exercised a great influence on all
Greek thought, and perhaps was one of the sources from which science
derived the belief in natural law.

Homeric gods were the gods of a conquering aristocracy, 
not the useful fertility gods of those who actually tilled the soil. 
As Gilbert Murray says

"The gods of most nations claim to have created the world. 
The Olympians make no such claim. The most they ever did was 
to conquer it. ... And when they have conquered their kingdoms, 
what do they do? Do they attend to the government? Do they 
promote agriculture? Do they practice trades and industries? 
Not a bit of it. Why should they do any honest work? They 
find it easier to live on the revenues and blast with thunderbolts 
the people who do not pay. They are conquering chieftains, 
royal buccaneers. They fight, and feast, and play, and make 
music; they drink deep, and roar with laughter at the lame smith 
who waits on them. They are never afraid, except of their own 
king. They never tell lies, except in love and war."[^9] 

[^9]: _Five Stages of Greek Religion_, p. 67. 

Homer's human heroes, equally, are not very well behaved. 
The leading family is the House of Pelops, but it did not succeed 
in setting a pattern of happy family life. 

> Tantalos, the Asiatic founder of the dynasty, began its career by a
> direct offense against the gods; some said, by trying to cheat them

Homer as a finished achievement was a product of Ionia, i.e. of a part
of Hellenic Asia Minor and the adjacent islands. Some time during the
sixth century at latest, the Homeric poems became fixed in their
present form. It was also during this century that Greek science and
philosophy and mathematics began. At the same time events of
fundamental importance were happening in other parts of the
world. Confucius, Buddha, and Zoroaster, if they existed, probably
belong to the same century.[^11] In the middle of the century the
Persian Empire was established by Cyrus; towards its close the Greek
cities of Ionia, to which the Persians had allowed a limited autonomy,
made a fruitless rebellion, which was put down by Darius, and their
best men became exiles. Several of the philosophers of this period
were refugees, who wandered from city to city in the still unenslaved
parts of the Hellenic world, spreading the civilization that, until
then, had been mainly confined to Ionia. They were kindly treated in
their wanderings. Xenophanes, who flourished in the later part of the
sixth century, and who was one of the refugees, says: "This is the
sort of thing we should say by the fireside in the winter-time, as we
lie on soft couches, after a good meal, drinking sweet wine and
crunching chickpeas: 'Of what country are you, and how old are you,
good Sir? And how old were you when the Mede appeared?'" The rest of
Greece succeeded in preserving its independence at the battles of
Salamis and Plataea, after which Ionia was liberated for a time.[^12]

[^11]: Zoroaster's date, however, is very conjectural. Some place it as early 
as 1000 BC. See _Cambridge Ancient History_, Vol. IV, p. 207. 

[^12]: As a result of the defeat of Athens by Sparta, the Persians regained 
the whole coast of Asia Minor, to which their right was acknowledged in 
the Peace of Antalcidas (387-6 BC). About fifty years later, they were 
incorporated in Alexander's empire. 

Greece was divided into a large number of small independent 
states, each consisting of a city with some agricultural territory 
surrounding it. The level of civilization was very different in 
different parts of the Greek world, and only a minority of cities 
contributed to the total of Hellenic achievement. Sparta, of which 
I shall have much to say later, was important in a military sense, 
but not culturally. Corinth was rich and prosperous, a great 
commercial center but not prolific in great men. 

Then there were purely agricultural rural communities, such 
as the proverbial Arcadia, which townsmen imagined to be 
idyllic, but which really was full of ancient barbaric horrors. 

The inhabitants worshipped Hermes and Pan, and had a multitude of
fertility cults, in which, often, a mere square pillar did duty in
place of a statue of the god. The goat was the symbol of fertility,
because the peasants were too poor to possess bulls.  When food was
scarce, the statue of Pan was beaten. (Similar things are still done
in remote Chinese villages.) There was a clan of supposed were-wolves,
associated, probably, with human sacrifice and cannibalism. It was
thought that whoever tasted the flesh of a sacrificed human victim
became a were-wolf. There was a cave sacred to Zeus Lykaios (the
wolf-Zeus); in this cave no one had a shadow, and whoever entered it
died within a year.  All this superstition was still flourishing in
classical times.[^13]

[^13]: Rose, _Primitive Greece_, p. 65 II. 

Pan, whose original name (some say) was "Paon", meaning the feeder or
shepherd, acquired his better-known title, interpreted as meaning the
All-God, when his worship was adopted by Athens in the fifth century,
after the Persian war.[^14]

[^14]: J. E. Harrison, _Prolegomema to the Study of Greek Religion_, p. 651. 

There was, however, in ancient Greece, much that we can feel to have
been religion as we understand the term. This was connected, not with
the Olympians, but with Dionysus, or Bacchus, whom we think of most
naturally as the somewhat disreputable god of wine and drunkenness. The
way in which, out of his worship, there arose a profound mysticism,
which greatly influenced many of the philosophers, and even had a part
in shaping Christian theology, is very remarkable, and must be
understood by anyone who wishes to study the development of Greek
thought.

Dionysus, or Bacchus, was originally a Thracian god. The 
Thracians were very much less civilized than the Greeks, who 
regarded them as barbarians. Like all primitive agriculturists, 
they had fertility cults, and a god who promoted fertility. Mis 
name was Bacchus. It was never quite clear whether Bacchus 
had the shape of a man or of a bull. When they discovered how 
to make beer, they thought intoxication divine, and gave honor 
to Bacchus. When, later, they came to know the vine and to learn 
to drink wine, they thought even better of him. His functions in 
promoting fertility in general became somewhat subordinate 
to his functions in relation to the grape and the divine madness 
produced by wine. 

At what date his worship migrated from Thrace to Greece is not known,
but it seems to have been just before the beginning of historical
times. The cult of Bacchus was met with hostility by the orthodox, but
nevertheless it established itself. It contained many barbaric
elements, such as tearing wild animals to pieces and eating the whole
of them raw. It had a curious element of feminism. Respectable matrons
and maids, in large companies, would spend whole nights on the bare
hills in dances which stimulated ecstasy, and in an intoxication
perhaps partly alcoholic, but mainly mystical. Husbands found the
practice annoying, but did not dare to oppose religion. Both the
beauty and the savagery of the cult are set forth in the Bacchae of
Euripides.

The success of Dionysus in Greece is not surprising. Like all
communities that have been civilized quickly, the Greeks, or at least
a certain proportion of them, developed a love of the primitive, and a
hankering after a more instinctive and passionate way of life than
that sanctioned by current morals. To the man or woman who, by
compulsion, is more civilized in behavior than in feeling,
rationality is irksome and virtue is felt as a burden and a
slavery. This leads to a reaction in thought, in feeling, and in
conduit. It is the reaction in thought that will specially concern us,
but something must first be said about the reaction in feeling and
conduct.

The civilized man is distinguished from the savage mainly by
_prudence_ or, to use a slightly wider term, _forethought_. He is
willing to endure present pains for the sake of future pleasures, even
if the future pleasures are rather distant. This habit began to be
important with the rise of agriculture; no animal and no savage would
work in the spring in order to have food next winter, except for a few
purely instinctive forms of action, such as bees making honey or
squirrels burying nuts. In these cases, there is no forethought;
there is a direct impulse to an act which, to the human spectator, is
obviously going to prove useful later on. True forethought only arises
when a man does something towards which no impulse urges him, because
his reason tells him that he will profit by it at some future
date. Hunting requires no forethought because it is pleasurable; but
tilling the soil is labour, and cannot be done from spontaneous
impulse.

Civilization checks impulse not only through forethought, 
which is a self-administered check, but also through law, custom, 
and religion. This check it inherits from barbarism, but it makes 
it less instinctive and more systematic. Certain acts are labelled 
criminal, and are punished; certain others, though not punished 
by law, are labelled wicked, and expose those who arc guilty of 
them to social disapproval. The institution of private property 
brings with it the subjection of women, and usually the creation 
of a slave class. On the one hand the purposes of the community 
are enforced upon the individual, and, on the other hand the 
individual, having acquired the habit of viewing his life as a 
whole, increasingly sacrifices his present to his future. 

It is evident that this process can be carried too far, as it is, for
instance, by the miser. But without going to such extremes prudence
may easily involve the loss of some of the best things in life. The
worshipper of Dionysus reacts against prudence. In intoxication,
physical or spiritual, he recovers an intensity of feeling which
prudence had destroyed; he finds the world full of delight and beauty,
and his imagination is suddenly liberated from the prison of every-day
preoccupations. The Bacchic ritual produced what was called
"enthusiasm," which means, etymologically, having the god enter into
the worshipper, who believed that he became one with the god. Much of
what is greatest in human achievement involves some element of
intoxication,[^15] some sweeping away of prudence by passion. Without
the Bacchic element, life would be uninteresting; with it, it is
dangerous. Prudence versus passion is a conflict that runs through
history. It is not a conflict in which we ought to side wholly with
either party.

[^15]: I mean mental intoxication, not intoxication by alcohol. 

In the sphere of thought, sober civilization is roughly synonymous
with science. But science, unadulterated, is not satisfying; men need
also passion and art and religion. Science may set limits to
knowledge, but should not set limits to imagination.  Among Greek
philosophers, as among those of later times, there were those who were
primarily scientific and those who were primarily religious; the
latter owed much, directly or indirectly, to the religion of
Bacchus. This applies especially to Plato, and through him to those
later developments which were ultimately embodied in Christian
theology.

The worship of Dionysus in its original form was savage, and 
in many ways repulsive. It was not in this form that it influenced 
the philosophers, but in the spiritualized form attributed to 
Orpheus, which was ascetic, and substituted mental for physical 
intoxication. 

Orpheus is a dim but interesting figure. Some hold that he was 
an actual man, others that he was a god or an imaginary hero. 
Traditionally, he came from Thrace, like Bacchus, but it seems 
more probable that he (or the movement associated with his name) 
came from Crete. It is certain that Orphic doctrines contain 
much that seems to have its first source in Egypt, and it was 
chiefly through Crete that Egypt influenced Greece. Orpheus is 
said to have been a reformer who was torn to pieces by frenzied 
Maenads actuated by Bacchic orthodoxy. His addiction to music 
is not so prominent in the older forms of the legend as it became 
later. Primarily he was a priest and a philosopher. 

Whatever may have been the teaching of Orpheus (if he existed), 
the teaching of the Orphics is well known. They believed in the 
transmigration of souls; they taught that the soul hereafter 
might achieve eternal bliss or suffer eternal or temporary torment 
according to its way of life here on earth. They aimed at becoming 
"pure," partly by ceremonies of purification, partly by avoiding 
certain kinds of contamination. The most orthodox among them 
abstained from animal food, except on ritual occasions when 
they ate it sacramentally. Man, they held, is partly of earth, 
partly of heaven; by a pure life the heavenly part is increased 
and the earthly part diminished. In the end a man may become 
one with Bacchus, and is called "a Bacchus." There was an 
elaborate theology, according to which Bacchus was twice born, 
once of his mother Semele, and once from the thigh of his father 
Zeus. 

There are many forms of the Dionysus myth. In one of them, Dionysus is
the son of Zeus and Persephone; while still a boy, he is torn to
pieces by Titans, who eat his flesh, all but the heart.  Some say that
the heart was given by Zeus to Semele, others that Zeus swallowed it;
in either case, it gave rise to the second birth of Dionysus. The
tearing of a wild animal and the devouring of its raw flesh by Bacchae
was supposed to re-enact the tearing and "eating of Dionysus by the
Titans, and the animal, in some sense, was an incarnation of the
god. The Titans were earth-born, but after eating the god they had a
spark of divinity.  So man is partly of earth, partly divine, and
Bacchic rites sought to make him more nearly completely divine.

Euripides puts a confession into the mouth of an Orphic priest, 
which is instructive[^16]:

> Lord of Europa's Tyrian line,  
> Zeus-born, who holdest at thy feet  
> The hundred citadels of Crete,  
> I seek to Thee from that dim shrine,  
>   
> Roofed by the Quick and Carven Beam,  
> By Chalyb steel and wild bull's blood.  
> In flawless joints of Cypress wood  
> Made steadfast. There is one pure stream  
>  
> My days have run. The servant I,  
> Initiate, of Idaean Jove;[^17]  
> Where midnight Zapreus[^18] roves, I rove;  
> I have endured his thunder-cry;  
>  
> Fulfilled his red and bleeding feasts;  
> Held the Great Mother's mountain flume,  
> I am set free and named by name  
> A Bacchos of the Mailed Priests.  
>  
> Robed in pure white I have borne me clean  
> From man's vile birth and coffined clay,  
> And exiled from my lip alway  
> Touch of all meat where Life hath been.

Orphic tablets have been found in tombs, giving instructions to 
the soul of the dead person as to how to find his way in the 
next world, and what to say in order to prove himself worthy of 
salvation. They are broken and incomplete; the most nearly 
complete (the Petelia tablet) is as follows: 

> Thou shall find on the left of the House of Hades a Well-spring,  
> And by the side thereof standing a white cypress.  
> To this well-spring approach not near.  
> But thou shalt find another by the Lake of Memory,  
> Cold water flowing forth, and there are Guardians before it,  
> Say: "I am a child of Earth and of Starry Heaven;  
> But my race is of Heaven (alone). This ye know yourselves.  
> And lo, I am parched with thirst and I perish. Give me quickly  
> The cold water flowing forth from the Lake of Memory."  
> And of themselves they will give thee to drink from the holy well-spring,  
> And thereafter among the other heroes thou shalt have lordship.... 

Another tablet says: "Hail, Thou who hast suffered the
suffering... Thou art become God from Man." And yet in another: "Happy
and Blessed One, thou shalt be God instead of mortal."

The well-spring of which the soul is not to drink is Lethe, which
brings forgetfulness; the other well-spring is Mnemosyne,
remembrance. The soul in the next world, if it is to achieve
salvation, is not to forget, but, on the contrary, to acquire a memory
surpassing what is natural.

The Orphics were an ascetic sect; wine, to them, was only a 
symbol, as, later, in the Christian sacrament. The intoxication that 
they sought was that of "enthusiasm," of union with the god. They 
believed themselves, in this way, to acquire mystic knowledge not 
obtainable by ordinary means. This mystical element entered into 
Greek philosophy with Pythagoras, who was a reformer of Orphism 
as Orpheus was a reformer of the religion of Dionysus. From 
Pythagoras Orphic elements entered into the philosophy of Plato, 
and from Plato into most later philosophy that was in any degree 
religious. 

Certain definitely Bacchic elements survived wherever Orphism 
had influence. One of these was feminism, of which there was 
much in Pythagoras, and which, in Plato, went so far as to claim 
complete political equality for women. "Women as a sex," says 
Pythagoras, "are more naturally akin to piety." Another Bacchic 
element was respect for violent emotion. Greek tragedy grew out 
of the rites of Dionysus. Euripides, especially, honored the two 
chief gods of Orphism, Dionysus and Eros. He has no respect for 
the coldly self-righteous well-behaved man, who, in his tragedies, 
is apt to be driven mad or otherwise brought to grief by the gods 
in resentment of his blasphemy. 

The conventional tradition concerning the Greeks is that they
exhibited an admirable serenity, which enabled them to contemplate
passion from without, perceiving whatever beauty it exhibited but
themselves calm and Olympian. This is a very one-sided view.  It is
true, perhaps, of Homer, Sophocles, and Aristotle, but it is
emphatically not true of those Greeks who were touched, directly or
indirectly, by Bacchic or Orphic influences. At Eleusis, where the
Eleusinian mysteries formed the most sacred part of Athenian State
religion, a hymn was sung, saying:

> With Thy wine-cup waving high,  
> With Thy maddening revelry,  
> To Eleusis' flowery vale,  
> Comest Thou Bacchus, Paean, hail!  

In the _Bacchae_ of Euripides, the chorus of Maenads displays a 
combination of poetry and savagery which is the very reverse of 
serene. They celebrate the delight in tearing a wild animal limb 
from limb, and eating it raw then and there: 

> O glad, glad on the Mountains  
> To swoon in the race outworn.  
> When the holy fawn-skin clings  
> And all else sweeps away,  
> To the joy of the quick red fountains,  
> The blood of the hill-goat torn,  
> The glory of wild-beast ravenings  
> Where the hill-top catches the day,  
> To the Phrygian, Lydian mountains  
> Tis Bromios leads the way.  

(Bromios was another of the many names of Dionysus.) The dance 
of the Maenads on the mountain side was not only fierce; it was 
an escape from the burdens and cares of civilization into the world 
of non-human beauty and the freedom of wind and stars. In a less 
frenzied mood they sing: 

Will they ever come to me, ever again, 
The long, long dances, 
On through the dark till the dim stars wane? 
Shall I feel the dew on my throat, and the stream 
Of wind in my hair? Shall our white feet gleam 
In the dim expanses? 
O feet of the fawn to the greenwood fled, 
Alone in the grass and the loveliness; 
Leap of the hunted, no more in dread, 
Beyond the snares and the deadly press. 
Yet a voice still in the distance sounds, 
A voice and a fear and a haste of hounds, 
O wildly labouring, fiercely fleet, 
Onward yet by river and glen--
Is it joy or terror, ye storm-swift feet? 
To the dear lone lands untroubled of men, 
Where no voice sounds, and amid the shadowy green 
The little things of the woodland live unseen. 

Before repeating that the Greeks were "serene," try to imagine 
the matrons of Philadelphia behaving in this manner, even in a 
play by Eugene O'Neill. 

The Orphic is no more "serene" than the unreformed worshipper of
Dionysus. To the Orphic, life in this world is pain and weariness. We
are bound to a wheel which turns through endless cycles of birth and
death; our true life is the stars, but we are tied to earth. Only by
purification and renunciation and an ascetic life can we escape from
the wheel and attain at last to the ecstasy of union with God. This is
not the view of men to whom life is easy and pleasant. It is more like
the Negro spiritual:

> I'm going to tell God all of my troubles  
> When I get home.  

Not all of the Greeks, but a large proportion of them, were 
passionate, unhappy, at war with themselves, driven along one 
road by the intellect and along another by the passions, with the 
imagination to conceive heaven and the willful self-assertion that 
creates hell. They had a maxim "nothing too much," but they 
were in fact excessive in everything in pure thought, in poetry, 
in religion, and in sin. It was the combination of passion and 
intellect that made them great, while they were great. Neither 
alone would have transformed the world for all future time as 
they transformed it. Their prototype in mythology is not 
Olympian Zeus, but Prometheus, who brought fire from heaven 
and was rewarded with eternal torment. 

If taken as characterizing the Greeks as a whole, however, what 
has just been said would be as one-sided as the view that the 
Greeks were characterized by "serenity." There were, in fact, two 
tendencies in Greece, one passionate, religious, mystical, otherworldly, the other cheerful, empirical, rationalistic, and interested 
in acquiring knowledge of a diversity of facts. Herodotus represents 
this latter tendency; so do the earliest Ionian philosophers; so, 
up to a point, does Aristotle. Beloch (_op. cit._, I, i, p. 434), after 
describing Orphism, says: 

> But the Greek nation was too full of youthful vigor for the general
> acceptance of a belief which denies this world and transfers real life
> to the Beyond. Accordingly the Orphic doctrine remained confined to
> the relatively narrow circle of the initiate, without acquiring the
> smallest influence on the State religion, not even in communities
> which, like Athens, had taken up the celebration of the mysteries into
> the State ritual and placed it under legal protection. A full
> millennium was to pass before these ideas---in a quite different
> theological dress, it is true---achieved victory in the Greek world.

It would seem that this is an overstatement, particularly as regards
the Eleusinian mysteries, which were impregnated with Orphism. Broadly
speaking, those who were of a religious temperament turned to Orphism,
while rationalists despised it. One might compare its status to that
of Methodism in England in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth
centuries.

We know more or less what an educated Greek learnt from his 
father, but we know very little of what, in his earliest years, he 
learnt from his mother, who was, to a great extent, shut out from 
the civilization in which the men took delight. It seems probable 
that educated Athenians, even in the best period, however 
rationalistic they may have been in their explicitly conscious 
mental processes, retained from tradition and from childhood a 
more primitive way of thinking and feeling, which was always 
liable to prove victorious in times of stress. For this reason, no 
simple analysis of the Greek outlook is likely to be adequate. 

The influence of religion, more particularly of non-Olympian religion,
on Greek thought was not adequately recognized until recent times. A
revolutionary book, Jane Harrison's _Prolegomena to the Study of Greek
Religion_, emphasized both the primitive and the Dionysiac elements in
the religion of ordinary Greeks; F. M.  Cornford's _From Religion to
Philosophy_ tried to make students of Greek philosophy aware of the
influence of religion on the philosophers, but cannot be wholly
accepted as trustworthy in many of its interpretations, or, for that
matter, in its anthropology.[^19] The most balanced statement known to
me is in John Burnet's _Early Greek Philosophy_, especially chapter
ii, "Science and Religion." A conflict between science and religion
arose, he says, out of "the religious revival which swept over Hellas
in the sixth century BC," together with the shifting of the scene from
Ionia to the West.  "The religion of continental Hellas," he says,
"had developed in a very different way from that of Ionia. In
particular, the worship of Dionysus, which came from Thrace, and is
barely mentioned in Homer, contained in germ a wholly new way of
looking at man's relation to the world. It would certainly be wrong to
credit the Thracians themselves with any very exalted wews; but there
can be no doubt that, to the Greeks, the phenomenon of ecstasy
suggested that the soul was something more than a feeble double of the
self, and that it was only when 'out of the body' that it could show
its true nature....

[^19]: On the other hand Cornford's books on various Platonic dialogues seem to me wholly admirable. 

> It looked as if Greek religion were about to enter on the same 
> stage as that already reached by the religions of the East; and, but 
> for the rise of science, it is hard to see what could have checked

> were organized as artificial communities. The poems which contained
> their theology were ascribed to the Thracian Orpheus, who had himself
> descended into Hades, and was therefore a safe guide through the
> perils which beset the disembodied soul in the next world.

Burnet goes on to state that there is a striking similarity between
Orphic beliefs and those prevalent in India at about the same time,
though he holds that there cannot have been any contact. He then comes
on to the original meaning of the word "orgy," which was used by the
Orphics to mean "sacrament," and was intended to purify the believer's
soul and enable it to escape from the wheel of birth. The Orphics,
unlike the priests of Olympian cults, founded what we may call
"churches" i.e. religious communities to which anybody, without
distinction of race or sex, could be admitted by initiation, and from
their influence arose the conception of philosophy as a way of life.

## Chapter II THE MILESIAN SCHOOL 

In every history of philosophy for students, the first thing mentioned
is that philosophy began with Thales, who said that everything is made
of water. This is discouraging to the beginner, who is
struggling---perhaps not very hard---to feel that respect for
philosophy which the curriculum seems to expect.  There is, however,
ample reason to feel respect for Thales, though perhaps rather as a
man of science than as a philosopher in the modern sense of the word.

Thales was a native of Miletus, in Asia Minor, a flourishing
commercial city, in which there was a large slave population, and a
bitter class struggle between the rich and poor among the free
population. "At Miletus the people were at first victorious and
murdered the wives and children of the aristocrats; then the
aristocrats prevailed and burned their opponents alive, lighting up
the open spaces of the city with live torches."[^20] Similar conditions
prevailed in most of the Greek cities of Asia Minor at the time of
Thales.

[^20]: Rostovtsev, _History of the Ancient World_, Vol. I, p. 204. 

Miletus, like other commercial cities of Ionia, underwent important
economic and political developments during the seventh and sixth
centuries. At first, political power belonged to a landowning
aristocracy, but this was gradually replaced by a plutocracy of
merchants. They, in turn, were replaced by a tyrant, who (as was
usual) achieved power by the support of the democratic party. The
kingdom of Lydia lay to the east of the Greek coast towns, but
remained on friendly terms with them until the fall of Nineveh (60O
BC). This left Lydia free to turn its attention to the West, but
Miletus usually succeeded in preserving friendly relations, especially
with Croesus, the last Lydian king, who was conquered by Cyrus in 546
BC. There were also important relations with Egypt, where the king
depended upon Greek mercenaries, and had opened certain cities to
Greek trade. The first Greek settlement in Egypt was a fort occupied
by a Milesian garrison; but the most important, during the period
610-560 BC, was Daphnae. Here Jeremiah and many other Jewish fugitives
took refuge from Nebuchadrezzar (Jeremiah xliii. 5 ff.); but while
Egypt undoubtedly influenced the Greeks, the Jews did not, nor can we
suppose that Jeremiah felt anything but horror towards the skeptical
Ionians.

As regards the date of Thales, the best evidence, as we saw, is that
he was famous for predicting an eclipse which, according to the
astronomers, must have taken place in 585 BC. Other evidence, such as
it is, agrees in placing his activities at about this time. It is no
proof of extraordinary genius on his part to have predicted an
eclipse. Miletus was allied with Lydia, and Lydia had cultural
relations with Babylonia, and Babylonian astronomers had discovered
that eclipses recur in a cycle of about nineteen years.  They could
predict eclipses of the moon with pretty complete success, but as
regards solar eclipses they were hampered by the fact that an eclipse
may be visible in one place and not in another.  Consequently they
could only know that at such and such a date it was worth while to
look out for an eclipse, and this is probably all that Thales
knew. Neither he nor they knew why there is this cycle.

Thales is said to have travelled in Egypt, and to have thence 
brought to the Greeks the science of geometry. What the Egyptians 
knew of geometry was mainly rules of thumb, and there is no 
reason to believe that Thales arrived at deductive proofs, such as 
later Greeks discovered. He seems to have discovered how to 
calculate the distance of a ship at sea from observations taken at 
two points on land, and how to estimate the height of a pyramid 
from the length of its shadow. Many other geometrical theorems 
are attributed to him, but probably wrongly. 

He was one of the Seven Wise Men of Greece, each of whom 
was specially noted for one wise saying; his, it is a mistake to 
suppose, was "water is best." 

According to Aristotle, he thought that water is the original 
substance, out of which all others are formed; and he maintained 
that the earth rests on water. Aristotle also says of him that he 
said the magnet has a soul in it, because it moves the iron; further, 
that all things arc full of gods.[^21] 

[^21]: Burnet (_Early Greek Philosophy_, p. 51) questions this last saying. 

The statement that everything is made of water is to be regarded as a
scientific hypothesis, and by no means a foolish one. Twenty years
ago, the received view was that everything is made of hydrogen, which
is two thirds of water. The Greeks were rash in their hypotheses, but
the Milesian school, at least, was prepared to test them
empirically. Too little is known of Thales to make it possible to
reconstruct him at all satisfactorily, but of his successors in
Miletus much more is known, and it is reasonable to suppose that
something of their outlook came from him. His science and his
philosophy were both crude, but they were such as to stimulate both
thought and observation.

There are many legends about him, but I do not think more is known
than the few facts I have mentioned. Some of the stories are pleasant,
for instance, the one told by Aristotle in his _Politics_ (1259a): "He
was reproached for his poverty, which was supposed to show that
philosophy is of no use. According to the story, he knew by his skill
in the stars while it was yet winter that there would be a great
harvest of olives in the corning year; so, having a little money, he
gave deposits for the use of all the olive-presses in Chios and
Miletus, which he hired at a low price because no one bid against
him. When the harvest time came, and many were wanted all at once and
of a sudden, he let them out at any rate which he pleased, and made a
quantity of money. Thus he showed the world that philosophers can
easily be rich if they like, but that their ambition is of another
sort."

Anaximander, the second philosopher of the Milesian school, is much
more interesting than Thales. His dates are uncertain, but he was said
to have been sixty-four years old in 546 BC, and there is reason to
suppose that this is somewhere near the truth.  He held that all
things come from a single primal substance, but that it is not water,
as Thales held, or any other of the substances that we know. It is
infinite, eternal and ageless, and "it encompasses all the worlds" for
he thought our world only one of many. The primal substance is
transformed into the various substances with which we are familiar,
and these are transformed into each other. As to this, he makes an
important and remarkable statement:

> Into that from which things take their rise they pass away once more,
> as is ordained, for they make reparation and satisfaction to one
> another for their injustice according to the ordering of time."

The idea of justice, both cosmic and human, played a part in Greek
religion and philosophy which is not altogether easy for a modern to
understand; indeed our word "justice" hardly expresses what is meant,
but it is difficult to find any other word that would be
preferable. The thought which Anaximander is expressing seems to be
this: there should be a certain proportion of fire, of earth, and of
water in the world, but each element (conceived as a god) is
perpetually attempting to enlarge its empire. But there is a kind of
necessity or natural law which perpetually redresses the balance;
where there has been fire, for examples, there are ashes, which are
earth. This conception of justice---of not overstepping eternally
fixed bounds---was one of the most profound of Greek beliefs. The gods
were subject to justice just as much as men were, but this supreme
power was not itself personal, and was not a supreme God.


Anaximander had an argument to prove that the primal substance could not be water, or any other known element. If one of 
these were primal, it would conquer the others. Aristotle reports 
him as saying that these known elements are in opposition to one 
another. Air is cold, water is moist, and fire is hot. "And therefore, 
if any one of them were infinite, the rest would have ceased to be 
by this time." The primal substance, therefore, must be neutral 
in this cosmic strife. 

There was an eternal motion, in the course of which was brought about
the origin of die worlds. The worlds were not created, as in Jewish or
Christian theology, but evolved. There was evolution also in the
animal kingdom. Living creatures arose from the moist element as it
was evaporated by the sun. Man, like every other animal, was descended
from fishes. He must be derived from animals of a different sort,
because, owing to his long infancy, he could not have survived,
originally, as he is now.

Anaximander was full of scientific curiosity. He is said to have been
the first man who made a map. He held that the earth is shaped like a
cylinder. He is variously reported as saying the sun is as large as
the earth, or twenty-seven times as large, or twenty-eight times as
large.

Wherever he is original, he is scientific and rationalistic. 

Anaximenes, the last of the Milesian triad, is not quite so 
interesting as Anaximander, but makes some important advances. 
His dates are very uncertain. He was certainly subsequent to 
Anaximander, and he certainly flourished before 494 BC, since 
in that year Miletus was destroyed by the Persians in the course 
of their suppression of the Ionian revolt. 

The fundamental substance, he said, is air. The soul is air; fire 
is rarefied air; when condensed, air becomes first water, then, if 
further condensed, earth, and finally stone. This theory has the 
merit of making all the differences between different substances 
quantitative, depending entirely upon the proportion

He thought that the earth is shaped like a round table, and that
air encompasses everything: "Just as our soul, being air, holds
us together, so do breath and air encompass the whole world." 
It seems that the world breathes.

Anaximenes was more admired in antiquity than Anaximander, though
almost any modern world would make the opposite valuation.  He had an
important influence on Pythagoras and on much subsequent speculation.
The Pythagoreans believed that the earth is spherical, but the
atomists adhered to the view of Anaximenes, that it is shaped like a
disc.

The Milesian school is important, not for what it achieved, but for
what it attempted. It was brought into existence by the contact of the
Greek mind with Babylonia and Egypt. Miletus was a rich commercial
city, in which primitive prejudices and superstitions were softened by
intercourse with many nations. Ionia, until its subjugation by Darius
at the beginning of the fifth century, was culturally the most
important part of the Hellenic world. It was almost untouched by the
religious movement connected with Dionysus and Orpheus; its religion
was Olympic, but seems to have been not taken very seriously. The
speculations of Thales, Anaximander, and Anaximenes are to be regarded
as scientific hypotheses, and seldom show any undue intrusion of
anthropomorphic desires and moral ideas. The questions they asked were
good questions, and their vigor inspired subsequent investigators.

The next stage in Greek philosophy, which is associated with the Greek
cities in southern Italy, is more religious, and, in particular, more
Orphic in some ways more interesting, admirable in achievement, but in
spirit less scientific than that of the Milesians.

## Chapter III PYTHAGORAS 

Pythagoras, whose influence in ancient and modern times is my subject
in this chapter, was intellectually one of the most important men that
ever lived, both when he was wise and when he was unwise. Mathematics,
in the sense of demonstrative deductive argument, begins with him, and
in him is intimately connected with a peculiar form of mysticism.  The
influence of mathematics on philosophy, partly owing to him, has, ever
since his time, been both profound and unfortunate.

Let us begin with what little is known of his life. He was a native of
the island of Samos, and flourished about 532 BC Some say he was the
son of a substantial citizen named Mnesarchos, others that he was the
son of the god Apollo; I leave the reader to take his choice between
these alternatives. In his time Samos was ruled by the tyrant
Polycrates, an old ruffian who became immensely rich, and had a vast
navy.

Samos was a commercial rival of Miletus; its traders went as 
far afield as Tartessus in Spain, which was famous for its mines. 
Polycrates became tyrant of Samos about 535 BC, and reigned 
until 515 BC He was not much troubled by moral scruples; he 
got rid of his two brothers, who were at first associated with him 
in the tyranny, and he used his navy largely for piracy. He profited 
by the fact that Miletus had recently submitted to Persia. In order 
to obstruct any further westward expansion of the Persians, he 
allied himself with Amasis, king of Egypt. But when Cambyses, 
king of Persia, devoted his full energies to the conquest of Egypt, 
Polycrates realized that he was likely to win, and changed sides. 
He sent a fleet, composed of his political enemies, to attack Egypt; 
but the crews mutinied and returned to Samos to attack him. 
He got the better of them, however, but fell at last by a treacherous 
appeal to his avarice. The Persian satrap at Sardes represented 
that he intended to rebel against the Great King, and would pay 
vast sums for the help of Polycrates, who went to the mainland 
for an interview, was captured and crucified.

Polycrates was a patron of the arts, and beautified Samos with 
remarkable public works. Anacreon was his court poet. Pythagoras, 
however, disliked his government, and therefore left Samos. It is 
said, and is not improbable, that Pythagoras visited Egypt, and 
learnt much of his wisdom there; however that may be, it is 
certain that he ultimately established himself at Croton, in 
southern Italy. 

The Greek cities of southern Italy, like Samos and Miletus, 
were rich and prosperous; moreover they were not exposed to 
danger from the Persians.[^22] The two greatest were Sybaris and 
Croton. Sybaris has remained proverbial for luxury; its population, in its greatest days, is said by Diodorus to have amounted to 
300,000, though this is no doubt an exaggeration. Croton was 
about equal in size to Sybaris. Both cities lived by importing 
Ionian wares into Italy, partly for consumption in that country, 
partly for re-export from the western coast to Gaul and Spain. 
The various Greek cities of Italy fought each other fiercely; when 
Pythatroras arrived in Croton, it had just been defeated by Locri. 
Soon after his arrival, however, Croton was completely victorious 
in a war against Sybaris, which was utterly destroyed (510 BC). 
Sybaris had been closely linked in commerce with Miletus. Croton 
was famous for medicine; a certain Democedes of Croton became 
physician to Polycrates and then to Darius. 

[^22]: The Greek cities of Sicily were in danger from the Carthaginians, but in Italy this danger was not felt to be imminent. 

At Croton Pythagoras founded a society of disciples, which for 
a time was influential in that city. But in the end the citizens 
turned against him, and he moved to Metapontion (also in southern 
Italy), where he died. He soon became a mythical figure, credited 
with miracles and magic powers, but he was also the founder of a 
school of mathematicians.[^23] Thus two opposing traditions disputed 
his memory, and the truth is hard to disentangle. 

[^23]: Aristotle says of him that he "first worked at mathematics and arithmetic, and afterwards, at one time, condescended to the wonder-working practiced by Pherecydes." 

Pythagoras is one of the most interesting and puzzling men in 
history. Not only are the traditions concerning him an almost 
inextricable mixture of truth and falsehood, but even in their 
barest and least disputable form they present us with a very 
curious psychology. He may be described, briefly, as a combination of Einstein and Mrs. Eddy. He founded a religion, of which the main tenets were the transmigration of souls and the sinfulness of eating beans. His religion was embodied in a religious order, which, here and there, acquired control of the State and established a rule of the saints. But the unregenerate hankered after beans, and sooner or later rebelled.

Some of the rules of the Pythagorean order were:

 * To abstain from beans.
 * Not to pick up what has fallen.
 * Not to touch a white cock.
 * Not to break bread.
 * Not to step over a crossbar.
 * Not to stir the fire with iron.
 * Not to eat from a whole loaf.
 * Not to pluck a garland.
 * Not to sit on a quart measure.
 * Not to eat the heart.
 * Not to walk on highways.
 * Not to let swallows share one's roof.
 * When the pot is taken off the fire, not to leave the mark of it in the ashes, but to stir them together.
 * Do not look in a mirror beside a light.
 * When you rise from the bedclothes, roll them together and smooth out the impress of the body. 

All these precepts belong to primitive tabu-conceptions. 

Cornford (_From Religion to Philosophy_) says that, in his opinion,
"The School of Pythagoras represents the main current of that mystical
tradition which we have set in contrast with the scientific tendency."
He regards Parmenides, whom he calls "the discoverer of logic", as "an
offshoot of Pythagoreanism, and plato himself as finding in the
Italian philosophy the chief source of his inspiration."
Pythagoreanism, he says, was a movement of reform in Orphism, and
Orphism was a movement of reform in the worship of Dionysus. The
opposition of the rational and the mystical, which runs all through
history, first appears, among the Greeks, as an opposition between the
Olympic gods and those other less civilized gods who had more affinity
with the primitive beliefs dealt with by anthropologists. In this
division, Pythagoras was on the side of mysticism, though his
mysticism was of a peculiarly intellectual sort. He attributed to
himself a semi-divine character, and appears to have said: "There are
men and gods, and beings like Pythagoras." All the systems that he
inspired, Cornford says, "tend to be otherworldly, putting all value
in the unseen unity of God, and condemning the visible world as false
and illusive, a turbid medium in which the rays of heavenly light are
broken and obscured in mist and darkness."

Dikaiarchos says that Pythagoras taught "first, that the soul is an
immortal thing, and that it is transformed into other kinds of living
things; further that whatever comes into existence is born again in
the revolutions of a certain cycle, nothing being abosolutely new; and
that all things that are born with life in them ought to be treated as
kindred."[^24] It is said that Pythagoras, like St Francis, preached to animals.

[^24]: Cornford, _op. cit_, p. 201.

But what has all this to do with mathematics? It is connected by means of an ethic which praised the contemplative life. Burnet sums up this ethic as follows:

> We are strangers in this world, and the body is the tomb of the
> soul, and yet we must not seek to escape by self-murder; for we are
> the chattels of God who is our herdsman, and without His command we
> have no right to make our escape. In this life, there are three
> kinds of men, just as there are three sorts of people who come to
> the Olympic Games. The lowest class is made up of those who come to

The changes in the meanings of words are often very instructive. 
I spoke above about the word "orgy"; now I want to speak about 
the word "theory." This was originally an Orphic word, which 
Cornford interprets as "passionate sympathetic contemplation." 
In this state, he says. "The spectator is identified with the suffering 
God, dies in his death, and rises again in his new birth." For 
Pythagoras, the "passionate sympathetic contemplation" was 
intellectual, and issued in mathematical knowledge. In this way, 
through Pythagoreanism, "theory" gradually acquired its modern 
meaning; but for all who were inspired by Pythagoras it retained 
an element of ecstatic revelation. To those who have reluctantly 
learnt a little mathematics in school this may seem strange; but 
to those who have experienced the intoxicating delight of sudden 
understanding that mathematics gives, from time to time, to those 
who love it, the Pythagorean view will seem completely natural 
even if untrue. It might seem that the empirical philosopher is 
the slave of his material, but that the pure mathematician, like 
the musician, is a free creator of his world of ordered beauty. 

It is interesting to observe, in Burnet's account of the Pythagorean
ethic, the opposition to modern values. In connection with a football
match, modern-minded men think the players grander than the mere
spectators. Similarly as regards the State: they admire more the
politicians who are the contestants in the game than those who are
only onlookers. This change of values is connected with a change in
the social system the warrior, the gentleman, the plutocrat, and the
dictator, each has his own standard of the good and the true. The
gentleman has had a long innings in philosophical theory, because he
is associated with the Greek genius, because the virtue of
contemplation acquired theological endorsement, and because the ideal
of disinterested truth dignified the academic life. The gentleman is
to be defined as one of a society of equals who live on slave labor,
or at any rate upon the labor of men whose inferiority is
unquestioned.  It should be observed that this definition includes the
saint and the sage, insofar as these men's lives are contemplative
rather than active.

Modern definitions of truth, such as those of pragmatism and 
instrumentalism, which are practical rather than contemplative, 
are inspired by industrialism as opposed to aristocracy. 

Whatever may be thought of a social system which tolerates 
slavery, it is to gentlemen in the above sense that we owe pure 
mathematics. The contemplative ideal, since it led to the creation 
of pure mathematics, was the source of a useful activity; this 
increased its prestige, and gave it a success in theology, in 
ethics, and in philosophy, which it might not otherwise have 
enjoyed. 

So much by way of explanation of the two aspects of Pythagoras: 
as religious prophet and as pure mathematician. In both respects 
he was immeasurably influential, and the two were not so separate 
as they seem to a modern mind. 

Most sciences, at their inception, have been connected with some form
of false belief, which gave them a fictitious value.  Astronomy was
connected with astrology, chemistry with alchemy.  Mathematics was
associated with a more refined type of error.  Mathematical knowledge
appeared to be certain, exact, and applicable to the real world;
moreover it was obtained by mere thinking, without the need of
observation. Consequently, it was thought to supply an ideal, from
which every-day empirical knowledge fell short. It was supposed, on
the basis of mathematics, that thought is superior to sense, intuition
to observation. If the world of sense does not fit mathematics, so
much the worse for the world of sense. In various ways, methods of
approaching nearer to the mathematician's ideal were sought, and the
resulting suggestions were the source of much that was mistaken in
metaphysics and theory of knowledge. This form of philosophy begins
with Pythagoras.

Pythagoras, as everyone knows, said that "all things are numbers."
This statement, interpreted in a modern way, is logically nonsense,
but what he meant was not exactly nonsense.  He discovered the
importance of numbers in music, and the connection which he
established between music and arithmetic survives in the mathematical
terms "harmonic mean" and "harmonic progression." He thought of
numbers as shapes, as they appear on dice or playing cards. We still
speak of squares and cubes of numbers, which are terms that we owe to
him. He also spoke of oblong numbers, triangular numbers, pyramidal
numbers, and so on. These were the numbers of pebbles (or, as we
should more naturally say, shot) required to make the shapes in
question. He presumably thought of the world as atomic, and of bodies
as built up of molecules composed of atoms arranged in various
shapes. In this way he hoped to make arithmetic the fundamental study 
in physics as in aesthetics. 

The greatest discovery of Pythagoras, or of his immediate disciples,
was the proposition about right-angled triangles, that the sum of the
squares on the sides adjoining the right angle is equal to the square
on the remaining side, the hypotenuse. The Egyptians had known that a
triangle whose sides are 3, 4, 5 has a right angle, but apparently the
Greeks were the first to observe that 3^2 + 4^2 =5^2, and, acting on
this suggestion, to discover a proof of the general proposition.

Unfortunately for Pythaponis, his theorem led at once to the discovery
of incommensurables, which appeared to disprove his whole
philosophy. In a right-angled isosceles triangle, the square on the
hypotenuse is double of the square on either side. Let us suppose each
side an inch long; then how long is the hypotenuse?  Let us suppose
its length is m/n inches. Then m^2/n^2 = 2. If m and n have a common
factor, divide it out, then either m or n must be odd. Now m^2 = 2n^2,
therefore m^2 is even, therefore m is even, therefore n is
odd. Suppose m == 2p. Then 4p^2 = 2n^2, therefore, n^2 = 2p^2 and
therefore n is even, _contra hyp_. Therefore no fraction m/n will
measure the hypotenuse. The above proof is substantially that in
Euclid, Book X.[^26]

[^26]: But not by Euclid. See Heath, _Greek Mathematics_. The above proof was probably known to Plato. 


This argument proved that, whatever unit of length we may adopt, there
are lengths which bear no exact numerical relation to the unit, in the
sense that there are no two integers m,n , such that m times the
length in question is n times the unit. This convinced the Greek
mathematicians that geometry must be established independently of
arithmetic. There are passages in Plato's dialogues which prove that
the independent treatment of geometry was well under way in his day;
it is perfected in Euclid.  Euclid, in Book II, proves geometrically
many things which we should naturally prove by algebra, such as
(a+b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2 . It was because of the difficulty about
incommensurables that he considered this course necessary. The same
applies to his treatment of proportion in Books V and VI. The whole
system is logically delightful, and anticipates the rigor of
nineteenth-century mathematicians. So long as no adequate arithmetical
theory of incommensurables existed, the method of Euclid was the best
that was possible in geometry. When Descartes introduced coordinate
geometry, thereby again making arithmetic supreme, he assumed the
possibility of a solution of the problem of incommensurables, though
in his day no such solution had been found.

The influence of geometry upon philosophy and scientific 
method has been profound. Geometry, as established by the 
Greeks, starts with axioms which are (or are deemed to be) self-evident, and proceeds, by deductive reasoning, to arrive at 
theorems that are very far from self-evident. The axioms and 
theorems are held to be true of actual space, which is something 
given in experience. It thus appeared to be possible to discover 
things about the actual world by first noticing what is self-evident 
and then using deduction. This view influenced Plato and Kant, 
and most of the intermediate philosophers. When the Declaration 
of Independence says "we hold these truths to be self-evident," 
it is modelling itself on Euclid. The eighteenth-century doctrine 
of natural rights is a search for Euclidean axioms in politics.[^27]
The form of Newton's _Principia_, in spite of its admittedly empirical 
material, is entirely dominated by Euclid. Theology, in its exact 
scholastic forms, takes its style from the same source. Personal 
religion is derived from ecstasy, theology from mathematics; and 
both arc to be found in Pythagoras. 

[^27]: "Self-evident" was substituted by Franklin for Jefferson's "sacred and undeniable." 

Mathematics is, I believe, the chief source of the belief in eternal
and exact truth, as well as in a super-sensible intelligible
world. Geometry deals with exact circles, but no sensible object is
exactly circular; however carefully we may use our compasses, there
will be some imperfections and irregularities. This suggests the view
that all exact reasoning applies to ideal as opposed to sensible
objects; it is natural to go further, and to argue that thought is
nobler than sense, and the objects of thought more real than those of
sense-perception. Mystical doctrines as to the relation of time to
eternity are also reinforced by pure mathematics, for mathematical
objects, such as numbers, if real at all, are eternal and not in
time. Such eternal objects can be conceived as God's thoughts. Hence
Plato's doctrine that God is a geometer, and Sir James Jeans' belief
that He is addicted to arithmetic.  Rationalistic as opposed to
apocalyptic religion has been, ever since Pythagoras, and notably ever
since Plato, very completely dominated by mathematics and mathematical
method.

The combination of mathematics and theology, which began with
Pythagoras, characterized religious philosophy in Greece, in the
Middle Ages, and in modern times down to Kant. Orphism before
Pythagoras was analogous to Asiatic mystery religions. But in Plato,
St. Augustine, Thomas Aquinas, Descartes, Spinoza, and Leibniz there
is an intimate blending of religion and reasoning, of moral aspiration
with logical admiration of what is timeless, which comes from
Pythagoras, and distinguishes the intellectualized theology of Europe
from the more straightforward mysticism of Asia. It is only in quite
recent times that it has been possible to say clearly where Pythagoras
was wrong. I do not know of any other man who has been as influential
as he was in the sphere of thought. I say this because what appears as
Platonism is, when analyzed, found to be in essence Pythagoreanism.
The whole conception of an eternal world, revealed to the intellect
but not to the senses, is derived from him. But for him, Christians
would not have thought of Christ as the Word; but for him, theologians
would not have sought logical proofs of Mod and immortality. But in
him all this is still implicit. How it became explicit will appear
as we proceed.

## Chapter IV: HERACLITUS 

Two opposite attitudes towards the Greeks are common at the present
day. One, which was practically universal from the Renaissance until
very recent times, views the Greeks with almost superstitious
reverence, as the inventors of all that is best, and as men of
superhuman genius whom the moderns cannot hope to equal. The other
attitude, inspired by the triumphs of science and by an optimistic
belief in progress, considers the authority of the ancients an
incubus, and maintains that most of their contributions to thought are
now best forgotten. I cannot myself take either of these extreme
views; each, I should say, is partly right and partly wrong. Before
entering upon any detail, I shall try to say what sort of wisdom we
can still derive from the study of Greek thought.

As to the nature and structure of the world, various hypotheses are
possible. Progress in metaphysics, so far as it has existed, has
consisted in a gradual refinement of all these hypotheses, a
development of their implications, and a reformulation of each to meet
the objections urged by adherents of rival hypotheses. To learn to
conceive the universe according to each of these systems is an
imaginative delight and an antidote to dogmatism. Moreover, even if no
one of the hypotheses can be demonstrated, there is genuine knowledge
in the discovery of what is involved in making each of them consistent
with itself and with known facts. Now almost all the hypotheses that
have dominated modern philosophy were first thought of by the Greeks;
their imaginative inventiveness in abstract matters can hardly be too
highly praised. What I shall have to say about the Greeks will be said
mainly from this point of view; I shall regard them as giving birth to
theories which have had an independent life and growth, and which,
though at first somewhat infantile, have proved capable of surviving
and developing throughout more than two thousand years.

The Greeks contributed, it is true, something else which proved of
more permanent value to abstract thought: they discovered mathematics
and the art of deductive reasoning. Geometry, in particular, is a
Greek invention, without which modern science would have been
impossible. But in connection with mathematics the one-sidedness of
the Greek genius appears: it reasoned deductively from what appeared
self-evident, not inductively from what had been observed. Its amazing
successes in the employment of this method misled not only the ancient
world, but the greater part of the modern world also. It has only been
very slowly that scientific method, which seeks to reach principles
inductively from observation of particular facts, has replaced the
Hellenic belief in deduction from luminous axioms derived from the
mind of the philosopher. For this reason, apart from others, it is a
mistake to treat the Greeks with superstitious reverence. Scientific
method, though some few among them were the first men who had an
inkling of it, is, on the whole, alien to their temper of mind, and
the attempt to glorify them by belittling the intellectual progress of
the last four centuries has a cramping effect upon modern thought.

There is, however, a more general argument against reverence, whether
for the Greeks or for anyone else. In studying a philosopher, the
right attitude is neither reverence nor contempt, but first a kind of
hypothetical sympathy, until it is possible to know what it feels like
to believe in his theories, and only then a revival of the critical
attitude, which should resemble, as far as possible, the state of mind
of a person abandoning opinions which he has hitherto held. Contempt
interferes with the first part of this process, and reverence with the
second. Two things are to be remembered: that a man whose opinions and
theories are worth studying may be presumed to have had some
intelligence, but that no man is likely to have arrived at complete
and final truth on any subject whatever. When an intelligent man
expresses a view which seems to us obviously absurd, we should not
attempt to prove that it is somehow true, but we should try to
understand how it ever came to seem true. This exercise of historical
and psychological imagination at once enlarges the scope of our
thinking, and helps us to realize how foolish many of our own
cherished prejudices will seem to an age which has a different temper
of mind.

Between Pythagoras and Heraclitus, with whom we shall be concerned in
this chapter, there was another philosopher, of less importance,
namely Xenophanes. His date is uncertain, and is mainly determined by
the fact that he alludes to Pythagoras and Heraclitus alludes to him.
He was an Ionian by birth, but lived most of his life in southern
Italy. He believed all things to be made out of earth and water. As
regards the gods he was a very emphatic free thinker. "Homer and
Hesiod have ascribed to the gods all things that are a shame and a
disgrace among mortals, stealings and adulteries and deceivings of one
another.... Mortals deem that gods are begotten as they are, and
have clothes like theirs, and voice and form... yes, and if oxen
and horses or lions had hands, and could paint with their hands, and
produce works of art as men do, horses would paint the forms of gods
like horses, and oxen like oxen, and make their bodies in the image of
their several kinds.... The Ethiopians make their gods black and
snub-nosed; the Thracians say theirs have blue eyes and red hair." He
believed in one God, unlike men in form and thought, who "without toil
swayeth all things by the force of his mind." Xenophanes made fun of
the Pythagorean doctrine of transmigration. "Once, they say, he
(Pythagoras) was passing by when a dog was being ill-treated. 'Stop,'
he said, 'don't hit it! It is the soul of a friend! I knew it when I
heard its voice.'" He believed it impossible to ascertain the truth in
matters of theology. "The certain truth there is no man who knows, nor
ever shall be, about the gods and all the things whereof I speak. Yea,
even if a man should chance to say something utterly right, still he
himself knows it not there is nowhere anything but guessing."[^28]

[^28]: Quoted from Edwyn Bevan, _Stoics and Skeptics_, Oxford, 1913, p. 121.

Xenophanes has his place in the succession of rationalists, who were
opposed to the mystical tendencies of Pythagoras and others, but as an
independent thinker he is not in the first rank.

The doctrine of Pythagoras, as we saw, is very difficult to
disentangle from that of his disciples, and although Pythagoras
himself is very early, the influence of his school is mainly
subsequent to that of various other philosophers. The first of these
to invent a theory which is still influential was Heraclitus, who
flourished about 500 BC. Of his life very little is known, except that
he was an aristocratic citizen of Ephesus. He was chiefly famous in
antiquity for his doctrine that everything is in a state of flux, but
this, as we shall see, is only one aspect of his metaphysics.

Heraclitus, though an Ionian, was not in the scientific tradition 
of the Milesians.[^29] He was a mystic, but of a peculiar kind. He 
regarded fire as the fundamental substance; everything, like flame 
in a fire, is born by the death of something else. "Mortals are 
immortals, and immortals are mortals, the one living the other's 
death and dying the other's life." There is unity in the world, 
but it is a unity formed by the combination of opposite?. "All 
things come out of the one, and the one out of all things' 1; but 
the many have less reality than the one, which is God. 

[^29]: Cornford, _op. cit._ (p. 184), emphasizes this, I think rightly. Heraclitus is often misunderstood through being assimilated to other Ionians.

From what survives of his writings he does not appear as an amiable
character. He was much addicted to contempt, and was the reverse of a
democrat. Concerning his fellow-citizens, he says: "The Ephesians
would do well to hang themselves, every grown man of them, and leave
the city to beardless lads; for they have cast out Hermodorus, the
best man among them, saying: 'We will have none who is best among us;
if there be any such, let him be so elsewhere and among others.'" He
speaks ill of all his eminent predecessors, with a single exception.
"Homer should be turned out of the lists and whipped." "Of all whose
discourses I have heard, there is not one who attains to understanding
that wisdom is apart from all." "The learning of many things teacheth
not understanding, else would it have taught Hesiod and Pythagoras,
and again Xenophanes and Hecataeus." "Pythagoras...claimed for his own
wisdom what was but a knowledge of many things and an art of
mischief." The one exception to his condemnations is Teutamus, who is
signalled out as "of more account than the rest." When we inquire the
reason for this praise, we find that Teutamus said "most men are bad."

His contempt for mankind leads him to think that only force will
compel them to act for their own good. He says: "Every beast is
driven to the pasture with blows"; and again: "Asses would rather have
straw than gold."

As might be expected, Heraclitus believes in war. "War," he says, "is
the father of all and the king of all; and some he has made gods and
some men, some bond and some free." Again: "Homer was wrong in saying:
'Would that strife might perish from among gods and men!' He did not
see that he was praying for the destruction of the universe; for, if
his prayer were heard, all things would pass away." And yet again: "We
must know that war is common to all and strife is justice, and that
all things come into being and pass away through strife."

His ethic is a kind of proud asceticism, very similar to Nietzsche's,
He regards the soul as a mixture of fire and water, the fire being
noble and the water ignoble. The soul that has most fire he calls
"dry." "The dry soul is the wisest and best." "It is pleasure to souls
to become moist." "A man, when he gets drunk, is led by a beardless
lad, tripping, knowing not where he steps, having his soul moist." "It
is death to souls to become water." "It is hard to fight with one's
heart's desire. Whatever it wishes to get, it purchases at the cost of
soul." "It is not good for men to get all that they wish to get." One
may say that Heraclitus values power obtained through self-mastery,
and despises the passions that distract men from their central
ambitions.

The attitude of Heraclitus to the religions of his time, at any rate
the Bacchic religion, is largely hostile, but not with the hostility
of a scientific rationalist. He has his own religion, and in part
interprets current theology to fit his doctrine, in part rejects it
with considerable scorn. He has been called Bacchic (by Cornford), and
regarded as an interpreter of the mysteries (by Pfieiderer). I do not
think the relevant fragments bear out this view. He says, for example:
"The mysteries practiced among men are unholy mysteries." This
suggests that he had in mind possible mysteries that would not be
"unholy," but would be quite different from those that existed. He
would have been a religious reformer, if he had not been too scornful
of the vulgar to engage in propaganda.

The following are all the extant sayings of Heraclitus that bear 
on his attitude to the theology of his day. 

> The Lord whose is the oracle of Delphi neither utters nor hides 
> his meaning, but shows it by a sign. 

> And the Sibyl, with raving lips uttering things mirthless,
> unbedizened and unperfumed, reaches over a thousand years with her
> voice, thanks to the god in her.

> Souls smell in Hades. 

> Greater deaths win greater portions. (Those who die them become
> gods.)

> Night-walkers, magicians, priests of Bacchus, and priestesses of the
> wine-vat, mystery-mongers.

> The mysteries practiced among men are unholy mysteries. 

> And they pray to these images, as if one were to talk with a 
> man's house, knowing not what gods or heroes are. 

> For if it were not to Dionysus that they made a procession and 
> sang the shameful phallic hymn, they would be acting most 
> shamelessly. But Hades is the same as Dionysus in whose honor 
> they go mad and keep the feast of the wine-vat. 

> They vainly purify themselves by defiling themselves with 
> blood, just as if one who had stepped into the mud were to wash 
> his feet in mud. Any man who marked him doing this, would 
> deem him mad. 

Heraclitus believed fire to be the primordial element, out of which
everything else had arisen. Thales, the reader will remember, thought
everything was made of water; Anaximenes thought air was the primitive
element; Heraclitus preferred fire. At last Empedocles suggested a
statesmanlike compromise by allowing four elements, earth, air, fire
and water. The chemistry of the ancients stopped dead at this point.
No further progress was made in this science until the Mohammedan
alchemists embarked upon their search for the philosopher's stone, the
elixir of life, and a method of transmuting base metals into gold.

The metaphysics of Heraclitus are sufficiently dynamic to 
satisfy the most hustling of moderns: 

> This world, which is the same for all, no one of gods or men has
> made; but it was ever, is now, and ever shall be an ever-living
> Fire, with measures kindling and measures going out.

> The transformations of Fire are, first of all, sea; and half of 
> the sea is earth, half whirlwind.

In such a world, perpetual change was to be expected, and
perpetual change was what Heraclitus believed in. 

He had, however, another doctrine on which he set even more 
store than on the perpetual flux; this was the doctrine of the 
mingling of opposites. "Men do not know," he says, "how what 
is at variance agrees with itself. It is an attunement of opposite 
tensions, like that of the bow and the lyre." His belief in strife 
is connected with this theory, for in strife opposites combine to 
produce a motion which is a harmony. There is a unity in the 
world, but it is a unity resulting from diversity: 

> Couples are things whole and things not whole, what is drawn
> together and what is drawn asunder, the harmonious and the
> discordant. The one is made up of all things, and all things issue
> from the one.

Sometimes he speaks as if the unity were more fundamental 
than the diversity: 

> Good and ill are one. 

> To God all things are fair and good and right, but men hold 
> some things wrong and some right.

>The way up and the way down is one and the same.

> God is day and night, winter and summer, war and peace, surfeit and
> hunger; but he takes various shapes, just as fire, when it is
> mingled with spices, is named according to the savor of each.

Nevertheless, there would be no unity if there were not opposites 
to combine: "it is the opposite which is good for us." 

This doctrine contains the germ of Hegel's philosophy, which 
proceeds by a synthesizing of opposites. 

The metaphysics of Heraclitus, like that of Anaximander, is 
dominated by a conception of cosmic justice, which prevents the 
strife of opposites from ever issuing in the complete victory of 
either. 

> All things are an exchange for Fire, and Fire for all things, 
> even as wares for gold and gold for wares.

> Fire lives the death of air, and air lives the death of fire; water 
> lives the death of earth, earth that of water.

> The sun will not overstep his measures; if he does, the Erinyes, 
> the handmaids of Justice, will find him out.

> We must know that war is common to all, and strife is justice.

Heraclitus repeatedly speaks of "God" as distinct from "the gods."
"The way of man has no wisdom, but that of God has.... Man is called a
baby by God, even as a child by a man.... The wisest man is an ape
compared to God, just as the most beautiful ape is ugly compared to
man."

God, no doubt, is the embodiment of cosmic justice. 

The doctrine that everything is in a state of flux is the most 
famous of the opinions of Heraclitus, and the one most emphasized 
by his disciples, as described in Plato's Theaetetus. 

> You cannot step twice into the same river; for fresh waters 
> are ever flowing in upon you."[^30]

[^30]: But cf. "We step and do not step into the same rivers: we are, and are not."

> The sun is new every day. 

His belief in universal change is commonly supposed to have 
been expressed in the phrase "all things are flowing" but this is 
probably apocryphal, like Washington's "Father, I cannot tell a 
lie" and Wellington's "Up Guards and at 'em." His words, like 
those of all the philosophers before Plato, are only known through 
quotations, largely made by Plato or Aristotle for the sake of 
refutation. When one thinks what would become of any modern 
philosopher if he were only known through the polemics of his 
rivals, one can see how admirable the pre-Socratics must have 
been, since even through the mist of malice spread by their 
enemies they still appear great. However this may be, Plato and 
Aristotle agree that Heraclitus taught that "nothing ever is, 
everything is becoming" (Plato), and that "nothing steadfastly is" 
(Aristotle). 

I shall return to the consideration of this doctrine in connection 
with Plato, who is much concerned to refute it. For the present, I 
shall not investigate what philosophy has to say about it, but 
only what the poets have felt and the men of science have taught. 

The search for something permanent is one of the deepest of 
the instincts leading men to philosophy. It is derived, no doubt, 
from love of home and desire for a refuge from danger; we find, 
accordingly, that it is most passionate in those whose lives are 
most exposed to catastrophe. Religion seeks permanence in two 
forms, God and immortality. In God is no variableness neither 
shadow of turning; the life after death is eternal and unchanging. 
The cheerfulness of the nineteenth century turned men against 
these static conceptions, and modern liberal theology believes 
that there is progress in heaven and evolution in the Godhead. 
But even in this conception there is something permanent, namely 
progress itself and its immanent goal. And a dose of disaster is 
likely to bring men's hopes back to their older super-terrestrial 
forms: if life on earth is despaired of, it is only in heaven that 
peace can be sought. 

The poets have lamented the power of Time to sweep away 
every object of their love. 

> Time doth transfix the flourish set on youth,  
> And delves the parallels in beauty 'a brow,  
> Feeds on the rarities of nature's truth,  
> And nothing stands but for his scythe to mow.  

They generally add that their own verses are indestructible: 

> And yet to times in hope my verse shall stand.  
> Praising thy worth, despite his cruel hand.  

But this is only a conventional literary conceit. 

Philosophically inclined mystics, unable to deny that whatever is in
time is transitory, have invented a conception of eternity as not
persistence through endless time, but existence outside the whole
temporal process. Eternal life, according to some theologians, for
example, Dean Inge, does not mean existence throughout every moment of
future time, but a mode of being wholly independent of time, in which
there is no before and after, and therefore no logical possibility of
change. This view has been poetically expressed by Vaughan:

> I saw Eternity the other night,  
> Like a great ring of pure and endless light,  
> All calm, as it was bright;  
> And round beneath it, Time in hours, days, years,  
> Driven by the spheres  
> Like a vast shadow moved; in which the world  
> And all her train were hurled.  

Several of the most famous systems of philosophy have tried 
to state this conception in sober prose, as expressing what reason, 
patiently pursued, will ultimately compel us to believe. 

Heraclitus himself, for all his belief in change, allowed something
everlasting. The conception of eternity (as opposed to endless
duration), which comes from Parmenides, is not to be found in
Heraclitus, but in his philosophy the central fire never dies: the
world "was ever, is now, and ever shall be, an ever-living Fire." But
fire is something continually changing, and its permanence is rather
that of a process than that of a substance though this view should not
be attributed to Heraclitus.

Science, like philosophy, has sought to escape from the doctrine of
perpetual flux by finding some permanent substratum amid changing
phenomena. Chemistry seemed to satisfy this desire. It was found that
fire, which appears to destroy, only transmutes: elements are
recombined, but each atom that existed before combustion still exists
when the process is completed. Accordingly it was supposed that atoms
arc indestructible, and that all change in the physical world consists
merely in re-arrangement of persistent elements. This view prevailed
until the discovery of radioactivity, when it was found that atoms
could disintegrate.

Nothing daunted, the physicists invented new and smaller units called
electrons and protons, out of which atoms were composed; and these
units were supposed, for a few years, to have the indestructibility
formerly attributed to atoms. Unfortunately it seemed that protons and
electrons could meet and explode, forming, not new matter, but a wave
of energy spreading through the universe with the velocity of light.
Energy had to replace matter as what is permanent. But energy, unlike
matter, is not a refinement of the common-sense notion of a "thing";
it is merely a characteristic of physical processes. It might be
fancifully identified with the Heraclitean Fire, but it is the
burning, not what burns. "What burns" has disappeared from modern
physics.

Passing from the small to the large, astronomy no longer allows us to
regard the heavenly bodies as everlasting. The planets came out of the
sun, and the sun came out of a nebula. It has lasted some time, and
will last some time longer; but sooner or later probably in about a
million million years it will explode, destroying all the planets. So
at least the astronomers say; perhaps as the fatal day draws nearer
they will find some mistake in their calculations.

The doctrine of the perpetual flux, as taught by Heraclitus, is 
painful, and science, as we have seen, can do nothing to refute it. 
One of the main ambitions of philosophers has been to revive 
hopes that science seemed to have killed. Philosophers, accordingly, 
have sought, with great persistence, for something not subject to 
the empire of Time. This search begins with Parmenides. 

## Chapter V PARMENIDES 

The Greeks were not addicted to moderation, either in their theories
or in their practice. Heraclitus maintained that everything changes;
Parmenides retorted that nothing changes.

Parmenides was a native of Elea, in the south of Italy, and flourished
in the first half of the fifth century BC. According to Plato,
Socrates in his youth (say about the year 450 BC) had an interview
with Parmenides, then an old man, and learnt much from him. Whether or
not this interview is historical, we may at least infer, what is
otherwise evident, that Plato himself was influenced by the doctrines
of Parmenides. The south Italian and Sicilian philosophers were more
inclined to mysticism and religion than those of Ionia, who were on
the whole scientific and skeptical in their tendencies. But
mathematics, under the influence of Pythagoras, flourished more in
Magna Graecia than in Ionia; mathematics at that time, however, was
entangled with mysticism. Parmenides was influenced by Pythagoras, but
the extent of this influence is conjectural. What makes Parmenides
historically important is that he invented a form of metaphysical
argument that, in one form or another, is to be found in most
subsequent metaphysicians down to and including Hegel. He is often
said to have invented logic, but what he really invented was
metaphysics based on logic.

The doctrine of Parmenides was set forth in a poem _On Nature_. 
He considered the senses deceptive, and condemned the multitude 
of sensible things as mere illusion. The only true being is "the 
One" which is infinite and indivisible. It is not, as in Heraclitus, 
a union of opposites, since there are no opposites. He apparently 
thought, for instance, that "cold" means only "not hot," and 
"dark" means only "not light." "The One" is not conceived by 
Parmenides as we conceive God; he seems to think of it as material 
and extended, for he speaks of it as a sphere. But it cannot be 
divided, because the whole of it is present everywhere. 

Parmenides divides his teaching into two parts, called respectively
"the way of truth" and "the way of opinion." We need not concern
ourselves with the latter. What he says about the way of truth, so far
as it has survived, is, in its essential points, as follows:

> Thou canst not know what is not that is impossible nor 
> utter it; for it is the same thing that can be thought and that 
> can be.

> How, then, can what is be going to be in the future? Or how 
> could it come into being? If it came into being, it is not; nor is it 
> if it is going to be in the future. Thus is becoming extinguished and 
> passing away not to be heard of. 

> The thing that can be thought and that for the sake of which 
> the thought exists is the same; for you cannot find thought without 
> something that is, as to which it is uttered."[^31]

[^31]: Burnet's note: "The meaning, I think, it this.... There can be no thought corresponding to a name that is not the name of something real."

The essence of this argument is: When you think, you think of
something; when you use a name, it must be the name of something.
Therefore both thought and language require objects outside
themselves. And since you can think of a thing or speak of it at one
time as well as at another, whatever can be thought of or spoken of
must exist at all times. Consequently there can be no change, since
change consists in things coming into being or ceasing to be.

This is the first example in philosophy of an argument from 
thought and language to the world at large. It cannot of course 
be accepted as valid, but it is worth while to see what element of 
truth it contains. 

We can put the argument in this way: if language is not just nonsense,
words must mean something, and in general they must not mean just
other words, but something that is there whether we talk of it or not.
Suppose, for example, that you talk of George Washington. Unless there
were a historical person who had that name, the name (it would seem)
would be meaningless, and sentences containing the name would be
nonsense. Parmenides maintains that not only must George Washington
have existed in the past, but in some sense he must still exist, since
we can still use his name significantly. This seems obviously untrue,
but how are we to get round the argument? Let us take an imaginary
person, say Hamlet. Consider the statement "Hamlet was Prince of
Denmark." In some sense this is true, but not in the plain historical
sense. The true statement is "Shakespeare says that Hamlet was Prince
of Denmark," or, more explicitly, "Shakespeare says there was a
Prince of Denmark called 'Hamlet.'" Here there is no longer anything
imaginary. Shakespeare and Denmark and the noise "Hamlet" are all
real, but the noise "Hamlet" is not really a name, since nobody is
really called "Hamlet." If you say "Hamlet is the name of an
imaginary person," that is not strictly correct; you ought to say "It
is imagined that 'Hamlet' is the name of a real person."

Hamlet is an imagined individual; unicorns are an imagined 
species. Some sentences in which the word "unicorn" occurs are 
true, and some are false, but in each case not directly. Consider 
"a unicorn has one horn" and "a cow has two horns." To prove 
the latter, you have to look at a cow; it is not enough to say that 
in some book cows are said to have two horns. But the evidence 
that unicorns have one horn is only to be found in books, and in 
fact the correct statement is: "Certain books assert that there are 
animals with one horn called 'unicorns'" All statements about 
unicorns are really about the word "unicorn," just as all statements 
about Hamlet are really about the word "Hamlet." 

But it is obvious that, in most cases, we are not speaking of words,
but of what the words mean. And this brings us back to the argument of
Parmenides, that if a word can be used significantly it must mean
something, not nothing, and therefore what the word means must in some
sense exist.

What, then, are we to say about George Washington? It seems 
we have only two alternatives: one is to say that he still exists; the 
other is to say that, when we use the words "George Washington," 
we are not really speaking of the man who bore that name. Either 
seems a paradox, but the latter is less of a paradox, and I shall 
try to show a sense in which it is true. 

Parmenides assumes that words have a constant meaning; this is really
the basis of his argument, which he supposes unquestionable. But
although the dictionary or the encyclopedia gives what may be called
the official and socially sanctioned meaning of a word, no two people
who use the same word have just the same thought in their minds.

George Washington himself could use his name and the word "I" as
synonyms. He could perceive his own thoughts and the movements of his
body, and could therefore use his name with a fuller meaning than was
possible for any one else. His friends, when in his presence, could
perceive the movements of his body, and could divine his thoughts; to
them, the name "George Washington" still denoted something concrete in
their own experience. After his death they had to substitute memories
for perceptions, which involved a change in the mental processes
taking place when they used his name. For us, who never knew him, the
mental processes are again different. We may think of his picture, and
say to ourselves "yes, that man." We may think "the first President of
the United States." If we are very ignorant, he may be to us merely
"The man who was called 'George Washington.'" Whatever the name
suggests to us, it must be not the man himself, since we never knew
him, but something now present to sense or memory or thought. This
shows the fallacy of the argument of Parmenides.

This perpetual change in the meanings of words is concealed by the
fact that, in general, the change nukes no difference to the truth or
falsehood of the propositions in which the words occur. If you take
any true sentence in which the name "George Washington" occurs, it
will, as a rule, remain true if you substitute the phrase "the first
President of the United States." There are exceptions to this rule.
Before Washington's election, a man might say "I hope George
Washington will be the first President of the United States," but he
would not say "I hope the first President of the United States will be
the first President of the United States" unless he had an unusual
passion for the law of identity. But it is easy to make a rule for
excluding these exceptional cases, and in those that remain you may
substitute for "George Washington" any descriptive phrase that applies
to him alone. And it is only by means of such phrases that we know
what we know about him.

Parmenides contends that, since we can now know what is commonly
regarded as past, it cannot really be past, but must, in some sense,
exist now. Hence he infers that there is no such thing as change. What
we have been saying about George Washington meets this argument. It
may be said, in a sense, that we have no knowledge of the past. When
you recollect, the recollection occurs now, and is not identical with
the event recollected. But the recollection affords a description of
the past event, and for most practical purposes it is unnecessary to
distinguish between the description and what it describes.

This whole argument shows how easy it is to draw metaphysical
conclusions from language, and how the only way to avoid fallacious
arguments of this kind is to push the logical and psychological study
of language further than has been done by most metaphysicians.

I think, however, that, if Parmenides could return from the dead and
read what I have been saying, he would regard it as very superficial.
"How do you know," he would ask, "that your statements about George
Washington refer to a past time? By your own account, the direct
reference is to things now present; your recollections, for instance,
happen now, not at the time that you think you recollect. If memory is
to be accepted as a source of knowledge, the past must be before the
mind now, and must therefore in some sense still exist."

I will not attempt to meet this argument now; it requires a discussion
of memory, which is a difficult subject. I have put the argument here
to remind the reader that philosophical theories, if they are
important, can generally be revived in a new form after being refuted
as originally stated. Refutations are seldom final; in most cases,
they are only a prelude to further refinements.

What subsequent philosophy, down to quite modern times, accepted from
Parmenides was not the impossibility of all change, which was too
violent a paradox, but the indestructibility of _substance_. The word
"substance" did not occur in his immediate successors, but the _concept_
is already present in their speculations. A substance was supposed to
be the persistent subject of varying predicates. As such it became,
and remained for more than two thousand years, one of the fundamental
concepts of philosophy, psychology, physics, and theology. I shall
have much to say about it at a later stage. For the present, I am
merely concerned to note that it was introduced as a way of doing
justice to the arguments of Parmenides without denying obvious facts.


## Chapter VI EMPEDOCLES 

The mixture of philosopher, prophet, man of science, and charlatan,
which we found already in Pythagoras, was exemplified very completely
in Empedocles, who flourished about 440 BC, and was thus a younger
contemporary of Parmenides, though his doctrine had in some ways more
affinity with that of Heraclitus. He was a citizen of Acragas, on the
south coast of Sicily; he was a democratic politician, who at the same
time claimed to be a god. In most Greek cities, and especially in
those of Sicily, there was a constant conflict between democracy and
tyranny; the leaders of whichever party was at the moment defeated
were executed or exiled. Those who were exiled seldom scrupled to
enter into negotiations with the enemies of Greece Persia in the East,
Carthage in the West. Empedocles, in due course, was banished, but he
appears, after his banishment, to have preferred the career of a sage
to that of an intriguing refugee. It seems probable that in youth he
was more or less Orphic; that before his exile he combined politics
and science; and that it was only in later life, as an exile, that he
became a prophet.

Legend had much to say about Empedocles. He was supposed to have
worked miracles, or what seemed such, sometimes by magic, sometimes by
means of his scientific knowledge. He could control the winds, we are
told; he restored to life a woman who had seemed dead for thirty days;
finally, it is said, he died by leaping into the crater of Etna to
prove that he was a god. In the words of the poet:

> Great Empedocles, that ardent soul,  
> Leapt into Etna, and was roasted whole.  

Matthew Arnold wrote a poem on this subject, but, although one 
of his worst, it does not contain the above couplet. 

Like Parmenides, Empedocles wrote in verse. Lucretius, who was
influenced by him, praised him highly as a poet, but on this subject
opinions were divided. Since only fragments of his writings have
survived, his poetic merit must remain in doubt.

It is necessary to deal separately with his science and his religion, 
as they are not consistent with each other. I shall consider first 
his science, then his philosophy, and finally his religion. 

His most important contribution to science was his discovery of 
air as a separate substance. This he proved by the observation that 
when a bucket or any similar vessel is put upside down into water, 
the water does not enter into the bucket. He says: 

> When a girl, playing with a water-clock of shining brass, puts the
> orifice of the pipe upon her comely hand, and dips the water-clock
> into the yielding mass of silvery water, the stream does not then
> flow into the vessel, but the bulk of the air inside, pressing upon
> the close-packed perforations, keeps it out till she uncovers the
> compressed stream; but then air escapes and an equal volume of water
> runs in.

This passage occurs in an explanation of respiration. 

He also discovered at least one example of centrifugal force: 
that if a cup of water is whirled round at the end of a string, the 
water does not come out. 

He knew that there is sex in plants, and he had a theory (somewhat
fantastic, it must be admitted) of evolution and the survival of the
fittest. Originally, "countless tribes of mortal creatures were
scattered abroad endowed with all manner of forms, a wonder to
behold." There were heads without necks, arms without shoulders, eyes
without foreheads, solitary limbs seeking for union. These things
joined together as each might chance; there were shambling creatures
with countless hands, creatures with faces and breasts looking in
different directions, creatures with the bodies of oxen and the faces
of men, and others with the faces of oxen and the bodies of men. There
were hermaphrodites combining the natures of men and women, but
sterile. In the end, only certain forms survived.

As regards astronomy: he knew that the moon shines by reflected light,
and thought that this is also true of the sun; he said that light
takes time to travel, but so little time that we cannot observe it; he
knew that solar eclipses are caused by the interposition of the
moon, a fact which he seems to have learnt from Anaxagoras.

He was the founder of the Italian school of medicine, and the 
medical school which sprang from him influenced both Plato and 
Aristotle. According to Burnet (p. 234), it affected the whole 
tendency pf scientific and philosophical thinking. 

All this shows the scientific vigor of his time, which was not 
equalled in the later ages of Greece. 

I come now to his cosmology. It was he, as already mentioned, who
established earth, air, fire, and water as the four elements (though
the word "element" was not used by him). Each of these was
everlasting, but they could be mixed in different proportions and thu
produce the changing complex substances that we find in the world.
They were combined by Love and separated by Strife. Love and Strife
were, for Empedocles, primitive substances on a level with earth, air,
fire, and water. There were periods when Love was in the ascendant,
and others when Strife was the stronger. There had been a golden age
when Love was completely victorious. In that age, men worshipped only
the Cyprian Aphrodite (fr. 128). The changes in the world are not
governed by any purpose, but only by Chance and Necessity. There is a
cycle: when the elements have been thoroughly mixed by Love, Strife
gradually sorts them out again; when Strife has separated them, Love
gradually reunites them. Thus even-compound substance is temporary;
only the elements, together with Love and Strife, are everlasting.

There is a similarity to Heraclitus, but a softening, since it is 
not Strife alone, but Strife and Love together, that produce 
change. Plato couples Heraclitus and Empedocles in the 
_Sophist_ (242): 

> There are Ionian, and in more recent time Sicilian, muses, who 
> have arrived at the conclusion that to unite the two principles (of 
> the One and the Many), is safer, and to say that being is one and 
> many, and that these are held together by enmity and friendship, 
> ever parting, ever meeting, as the severer Muses assert, while the 
> gentler ones do not insist on the perpetual strife and peace, but 
> admit a relaxation and alternation of them; peace and unity 
> sometimes prevailing under the sway of Aphrodite, and then 
> again plurality and war, by reason of a principle of strife. 

Empedocles held that the material world is a sphere; that in the
Golden Age Strife was outside and Love inside; then, gradually, Strife
entered and Love was expelled, until, at the worst, Strife will be
wholly within and Love wholly without the sphere. Then though for what
reason is not clear an opposite movement begins, until the Golden Age
returns, but not for ever. The whole cycle is then repeated. One might
have supposed that either extreme could be stable, but that is not the
view of Empedocles. He wished to explain motion while taking account
of the arguments of Parmenides, and he had no wish to arrive, at any
stage, at an unchanging universe.

The views of Empedocles on religion are, in the main, Pythagorean. In
a fragment which, in all likelihood, refers to Pythagoras, he says:
"There was among them a man of rare knowledge, most skilled in all
manner of wise works, a man who had won the utmost wealth of wisdom;
for whensoever he strained with all his mind, he easily saw everything
of all the things that are, in ten, yea twenty lifetimes of men." In
the Golden Age, as already mentioned, men worshipped only Aphrodite,
"and the altar did not reek with pure bull's blood, but this was held
in the greatest abomination among men, to eat the goodly limbs after
tearing out the life."

At one time he speaks of himself exuberantly as a god: 

> Friends, that inhabit the great city looking down on the yellow rock
> of Acragas, up by the citadel, busy in goodly works, harbor of
> honor for the stranger, men unskilled in meanness, all hail. I go
> about among you an immortal god, no mortal now, honored among all
> as is meet, crowned with fillets and flowery garlands. Straightway,
> whenever I enter with these in my train, both men and women, into
> the flourishing towns, is reverence done me; they go after me in
> countless throngs, asking of me what is the way to gain; some
> desiring oracles, while some, who for many a weary day have been
> pierced by the grievous pangs of all manner of sickness, beg to hear
> from me the word of healing.... But why do I harp on these things,
> as if it were any great matter that I should surpass mortal,
> perishable men?

At another time he feels himself a great sinner, undergoing 
expiation for his impiety: 

> There is an oracle of Necessity, an ancient ordinance of the gods, 
> eternal and sealed fast by broad oaths, that whenever one of the 
> daemons, whose portion is length of days, has sinfully polluted his 
> hands with blood, or followed strife and forsworn himself, he 
> must wander thrice ten thousand years from the abodes of the 
> blessed, being born throughout the time in all manners of mortal 
> forms, changing one toilsome path of life for another. For the 
> mighty Air drives him into the Sea, and the Sea spews him forth 
> upon the dry Earth; Earth tosses him into the beams of the 
> blazing Sun, and he flings him back to the eddies of Air. One takes 
> him from the other, and all reject him. One of these I now am, 
> an exile and a wanderer from the gods, for that I put my trust 
> in an insensate strife. 

What his sin had been, we do not know; perhaps nothing that 
we should think very grievous. For he says: 

> Ah, woe is me that the pitiless day of death did not destroy 
> me ere ever I wrought evil deeds of devouring with my lips!... 

> Abstain wholly from laurel leaves... 

> Wretches, utter wretches, keep your hands from beans!

So perhaps he had done nothing worse than munching laurel 
leaves or guzzling beans. 

The most famous passage in Plato, in which he compares this 
world to a cave, in which we see only shadows of the realities in 
the bright world above, is anticipated by Empedocles; its origin 
is in the teaching of the Orphics. 

There are some presumably those who abstain from sin 
through many incarnations who at last achieve immortal bliss 
in the company of the gods: 

> But at the last, they[^32] appear among mortal men as prophets,
> song-writers, physicians, and princes; and thence they rise up as
> gods exalted in honor, sharing the hearth of the other gods and the
> same table, free from human woes, safe from destiny, and incapable
> of hurt.

[^32]: It does not appear who "they" are, but one may assume that they are those who have preserved purity. 

In all this, it would seem, there is very little that was not already
contained in the teaching of Orphism and Pythagoreanism.

The originality of Empedocles, outside science, consists in the
doctrine of the four elements, and in the use of the two principles of
Love and Strife to explain change.

He rejected monism, and regarded the course of nature as regulated by
chance and necessity rather than by purpose. In these respects his
philosophy was more scientific than those of Parmenides, Plato, and
Aristotle. In other respects, it is true, he acquiesced in current
superstitions; but in this he was no worse than many more recent men
of science.


## Chapter VII ATHENS IN RELATION TO CULTURE 

The greatness of Athens begins at the time of the two 
Persian wars (490 BC and 480-79 BC). Before that time, 
Ionia and Magna Graecia (the Greek cities of south Italy 
and Sicily) produced the great men. The victory of Athens against 
the Persian king Darius at Marathon (490), and of the combined 
Greek fleets against his son and successor Xerxes (480) under 
Athenian leadership, gave Athens great prestige. The Ionians in 
the islands and on part of the mainland of Asia Minor had rebelled 
against Persia, and their liberation was effected by Athens after 
the Persians had been driven from the mainland of Greece. In 
this operation the Spartans, who cared only about their own 
territory, took no part. Thus Athens became the predominant 
partner in an alliance against Persia. By the constitution of the 
alliance, any constituent State was bound to contribute either a 
specified number of ships, or the cost of them. Most chose the 
latter, and thus Athens acquired naval supremacy over the other 
allies, and gradually transformed the alliance into an Athenian 
Empire. Athens became rich, and prospered under the wise 
leadership of Pericles, who governed, by the free choice of the 
citizens, for about thirty years, until his fall in 430 BC.

The age of Pericles was the happiest and most glorious time in the
history of Athens. Aeschylus, who had fought in the Persian wars,
inaugurated Greek tragedy; one of his tragedies, the _Persae_,
departing from the custom of choosing Homeric subjects, deals with the
defeat of Xerxes. He was quickly followed by Sophocles, and Sophocles
by Euripides. Both extend into the dark days of the Peloponnesian War
that followed the fall and death of Pericles, and Euripides reflects
in his plays the skepticism of the later period. His contemporary
Aristophanes, the comic poet, makes fun of all isms from the
standpoint of robust and limited common sense; more particularly, he
holds up Socrates to obloquy as one who denies the existence of Zeus
and dabbles in scientific mysteries.

Athens had been captured by Xerxes, and the temples on the Acropolis
had been destroyed by fire. Pericles devoted himself to their
reconstruction. The Parthenon and the other temples whose ruins remain
to impress our age were built by him. Pheidias the sculptor was
employed by the State to make colossal statues of gods and goddesses.
At the end of this period, Athens was the most beautiful and splendid
city of the Hellenic world.

Herodotus, the father of history, was a native of Halicarnassus, 
in Asia Minor, but lived in Athens, was encouraged by the 
Athenian State, and wrote his account of the Persian wars from 
the Athenian point of view. 

The achievements of Athens in the time of Pericles are perhaps the
most astonishing thing in all history. Until that time, Athens had
lagged behind many other Greek cities; neither in art nor in
literature had it produced any great man (except Solon, who was
primarily a lawgiver). Suddenly, under the stimulus of victory and
wealth and the need of reconstruction, architects, sculptors, and
dramatists, who remain unsurpassed to the present day, produced works
which dominated the future down to modern times. This is the more
surprising when we consider the smallness of the population involved.
Athens at its maximum, about 430 BC, is estimated to have numbered
about 230,000 (including slaves), and the surrounding territory of
rural Attica probably contained a rather smaller population. Never
before or since has anything approaching the same proportion of the
inhabitants of any area shown itself capable of work of the highest
excellence.

In philosophy, Athens contributes only two great names, 
Socrates and Plato. Plato belongs to a somewhat later period, but 
Socrates passed his youth and early manhood under Pericles. The 
Athenians were sufficiently interested in philosophy to listen 
eagerly to teachers from other cities. The Sophists were sought 
after by young men who wished to learn the art of disputation; 
in the _Protagoras_, the Platonic Socrates gives an amusing satirical 
description of the ardent disciples hanging on the words of the 
eminent visitor. Pericles, as we shall see, imported Anaxagoras, 
from whom Socrates professed to have learned the pre-eminence 
of mind in creation. 

Most of Plato's dialogues are supposed by him to take place 
during the time of Pericles, and they give an agreeable picture of 
life among the rich. Plato belonged to an aristocratic Athenian 
family, and grew up in the tradition of the period before war and 
democracy had destroyed the wealth and security of the upper 
classes. His young men, who have no need to work, spend most 
of their leisure in the pursuit of science and mathematics and 
philosophy; they know Homer almost by heart, and are critical 
judges of the merits of professional reciters of poetry. The art 
of deductive reasoning had been lately discovered, and afforded 
the excitement of new theories, both true and false, over the whole 
field of knowledge. It was possible in that age, as in few others, 
to be both intelligent and happy, and happy through intelligence. 

But the balance of forces which produced this golden age was 
precarious. It was threatened both from within and from without 
from within by the democracy, and from without by Sparta. 
To understand what happened after Pericles, we must consider 
briefly the earlier history of Attica. 

Attica, at the beginning of the historical period, was a
self-supporting little agricultural region; Athens, its capital, was
not large, but contained a growing population of artisans and skilled
artificers who desired to dispose of their produce abroad. Gradually
it was found more profitable to cultivate vines and olives rather than
grain, and to import grain, chiefly from the coast of the Black Sea.
This form of cultivation required more capital than the cultivation of
grain, and the small farmers got into debt. Attica, like other Greek
states, had been a monarchy in the Homeric age, but the king became a
merely religious official without political power. The government fell
into the hands of the aristocracy, who oppressed both the country
farmers and the urban artisans. A compromise in the direction of
democracy was effected by Solon early in the sixth century, and much
of his work survived through a subsequent period of tyranny under
Peisistratus and his sons. When this period came to an end, the
aristocrats, as the opponents of tyranny, were able to recommend
themselves to the democracy. Until the fall of Pericles, democratic
processes gave power to the aristocracy, as in nineteenth-century
England. But towards the end of his life the leaders of the Athenian
democracy began to demand a larger share of political power. At the
same time, his imperialist policy, with which the economic prosperity
of Athens was bound up, caused increasing friction with Sparta,
leading at last to the Peloponnesian War (431-404), in which Athens
was completely defeated.

In spite of political collapse, the prestige of Athens survived, 
and throughout almost a millennium philosophy was centered there. 

Alexandria eclipsed Athens in mathematics and science, but Plato 
and Aristotle had made Athens philosophically supreme. The 
Academy, where Plato had taught, survived all other schools, and 
persisted, as an island of paganism, for two centuries after the 
conversion of the Roman Empire to Christianity. At last, in 
AD 529, it was closed by Justinian because of his religious bigotry, 
and the Dark Ages descended upon Europe. 

## Chapter VIII ANAXAGORAS 

The philosopher Anaxagoras, though not the equal of 
Pythagoras, Heraclitus, or Parmenides, has nevertheless 
a considerable historical importance. He was an Ionian, 
and carried on the scientific, rationalist tradition of Ionia. He was 
the first to introduce philosophy to the Athenians, and the first 
to suggest mind as the primary cause of physical changes. 

He was born at Clazomenae, in Ionia, about the year 500 BC, 
but he spent about thirty years of his life in Athens, approximately 
from 462 to 432 BC. He was probably induced to come by Pericles, 
who was bent on civilizing his fellow-townsmen. Perhaps Aspasia, 
who came from Miletus, introduced him to Pericles. Plato, in the 
_Phaedrus_, says: 

> Pericles "fell in, it seems with Anaxagoras, who was a scientific 
> man; and satiating himself with the theory of things on high, and 
> having attained to a knowledge of the true nature of intellect and 
> folly, which were just what the discourses of Anaxagoras were 
> mainly about, he drew from that source whatever was of a nature 
> to further him in the art of speech.

It is said that Anaxagoras also influenced Euripides, but this 
is more doubtful. 

The citizens of Athens, like those of other cities in other ages 
and continents, showed a certain hostility to those who attempted 
to introduce a higher level of culture than that to which they were 
accustomed. When Pericles was growing old, his opponents began 
a campaign against him by attacking his friends. They accused 
Pheidias of embezzling some of the gold that was to be employed 
on his statues. They passed a law permitting impeachment of 
those who did not practice religion and taught theories about "the 
things on high." Under this law, they prosecuted Anaxagoras, 
who was accused of teaching that the sun was a red-hot stone 
and the moon was earth. (The same accusation was repeated by 
the prosecutors of Socrates, who made fun of them for being out 
of date.) What happened is not certain, except that Anaxagoras 
had to leave Athens. It seems probable that Pericles got him out 
of prison and managed to get him away. He returned to Ionia, 
where he founded a school. In accordance with his will, the 
anniversary of his death was kept as a schoolchildren's holiday. 

Anaxagoras held that everything is infinitely divisible, and that 
even the smallest portion of matter contains some of each element. 
Things appear to be that of which they contain most. Thus, for 
example, everything contains some fire, but we only call it fire if 
that element preponderates. Like Empedocles, he argues against 
the void, saying that the clepsydra or an inflated skin shows that 
there is air where there seems to be nothing. 

He differed from his predecessors in regarding mind (_nous_) as a 
substance which enters into the composition of living things, and 
distinguishes them from dead matter. In everything, he says, there 
is a portion of everything except mind, and some things contain 
mind also. Mind has power over all things that have life; it is 
infinite and self-ruled, and is mixed with nothing. Except as 
regards mind, everything, however small, contains portions of all 
opposites, such as hot and cold, white and black. He maintained 
that snow is black (in pant). 

Mind is the source of all motion. It causes a rotation, which is 
gradually spreading throughout the world, and is causing the 
lightest things to go to the circumference, and the heaviest to fall 
towards the center. Mind is uniform, and is just as good in animals 
as in man. Man's apparent superiority is due to the fact that he 
has hands; all seeming differences of intelligence are really due 
to bodily differences. 

Both Aristotle and the Platonic Socrates complain that Anaxagoras,
after introducing mind, makes very little use of it. Aristotle points
out that he only introduces mind as a cause when he knows no other.
Whenever he can, he gives a mechanical explanation. He rejected
necessity and chance as giving the origins of things; nevertheless,
there was no "Providence" in his cosmology. He does not seem to have
thought much about ethics or religion; probably he was an atheist, as
his prosecutors maintained. All his predecessors influenced him,
except Pythagoras. The influence of Parmenides was the same in his
case as in that of Empedocles.

In science he had great merit. It was he who first explained that the
moon shines by reflected light, though there is a cryptic fragment in
Parmenides suggesting that he also knew this. Anaxagoras gave the
correct theory of eclipses, and knew that the moon is below the sun.
The sun and stars, he said, are fiery stones, but we do not feel the
heat of the stars because they are too distant. The sun is larger than
the Peloponnesus. The moon has mountains, and (he thought)
inhabitants.

Anaxagoras is said to have been of the school of Anaximenes; certainly
he kept alive the rationalist and scientific tradition of the Ionians.
One does not find in him the ethical and religious preoccupations
which, passing from the Pythagoreans to Socrates and from Socrates to
Plato, brought an obscurantist bias into Greek philosophy. He is not
quite in the first rank, but he is important as the first to bring
philosophy to Athens, and as one of the influences that helped to form
Socrates.

## Chapter IX THE ATOMISTS 
The founders of atomism were two, Leucippus and Democritus. It is
difficult to disentangle them, because they are generally mentioned
together, and apparently some of the works of Leucippus were
subsequently attributed to Democritus. Leucippus, who seems to have
flourished about 440 BC,[^33] came from Miletus, and carried on the
scientific rationalist philosophy associated with that city. He was
much influenced by Parmenides and Zeno. So little is known of him that
Epicurus (a later follower of Democritus) was thought to have denied
his existence altogether, and some moderns have revived this theory.
There are, however, a number of allusions to him in Aristotle, and it
seems incredible that these (which include textual quotations) would
have occurred if he had been merely a myth.

[^33]: Cyril Bailey, _The Greek Atomists and Epicurus_, estimates that he flourished about 430 BC or a link earlier. 

Democritus is a much more definite figure. He was a native of Abdera
in Thrace; as for his date, he stated that he was young when
Anaxagoras was old, say about 432 BC, and he is taken to have
flourished about 420 BC. He travelled widely in southern and eastern
lands in search of knowledge; he perhaps spent a considerable time in
Egypt, and he certainly visited Persia. He then returned to Abdera,
where he remained. Zeller calls him "superior to all earlier and
contemporary philosophers in wealth of knowledge, and to most in
acuteness and logical correctness of thinking." Democritus was a
contemporary of Socrates and the Sophists, and should, on purely
chronological grounds, be treated somewhat later in our history. The
difficulty is that he is so hard to separate from Leucippus. On this
ground, I am considering him before Socrates and the Sophists,
although part of his philosophy was intended as an answer to
Protagoras, his fellow-townsman and the most eminent of the Sophists.
Protagoras, when he visited Athens, was received enthusiastically;
Democritus, on the other hand, says: "I went to Athens, and no one
knew me." For a long time, his philosophy was ignored in Athens; "It
is not clear," says Burnet, "that Plato knew anything about
Democritus.... Aristotle, on the other hand, knows Democritus well;
for he too was an Ionian from the North."[^34] Plato never mentions
him in the _Dialogues_, but is said by Diogenes Laertius to have
disliked him so much that he wished all his books burnt. Heath esteems
him highly as a mathematician.[^35]

[^34]: From Thales to Plato, p. 193. 
[^35]: _Greek Mathematics_, Vol. I, p. 176. 

The fundamental ideas of the common philosophy of Leucippus and
Democritus were due to the former, but as regards the working out it
is hardly possible to disentangle them, nor is it, for our purposes,
important to make the attempt. Leucippus, if not Democritus, was led
to atomism in the attempt to mediate between monism and pluralism, as
represented by Parmenides and Empedocles respectively. Their point of
view was remarkably like that of modern science, and avoided most of
the faults to which Greek speculation was prone. They believed that
everything is composed of atoms, which are physically, but not
geometrically, indivisible; that between the atoms there is empty
space; that atoms are indestructible; that they always have been, and
always will be, in motion; that there are an infinite number of atoms,
and even of kinds of atoms, the differences being as regards shape and
size. Aristotle[^36] asserts that, according to the atomists, atoms also
differ as regards heat, the spherical atoms, which compose fire, being
the hottest; and as regards weight, he quotes Democritus as saying
"The more any indivisible exceeds, the heavier it is." But the
question whether atoms are originally possessed of weight in the
theories of the atomists is a controversial one.

[^36]: _On Generation and Corruption_, 316. 

The atoms were always in motion, but there is disagreement 
among commentators as to the character of the original motion. 
Some, especially Zeller, hold that the atoms were thought to be 
always falling, and that the heavier ones fell faster; they thus 
caught up the lighter ones, there were impacts, and the atoms 
were deflected like billiard balls. This was certainly the view of 
Epicurus, who in most respects based his theories on those of 
Democritus, while trying, rather unintelligently, to take account 
of Aristotle's criticisms. But there is considerable reason to think 
that weight was not an original property of the atoms of Leucippus 
and Democritus. It seems more probable that, on their view, 
atoms were originally moving at random, as in the modern kinetic 
theory of gases. Democritus said there was neither up nor down 
in the infinite void, and compared the movement of atoms in the 
soul to that of motes in a sunbeam when there is no wind. This is 
a much more intelligent view than that of Epicurus, and I think 
we may assume it to have been that of Leucippus and Democritus.[^37] 

[^37]: This interpretation is adopted by Burnet, and also, at least as regards Leucippus, by Bailey (_op. cit._, p. 83). 

As a result of collisions, collections of atoms came to form 
vortices. The rest proceeded much as in Anaxagoras, but it was 
an advance to explain the vortices mechanically rather than as 
due to the action of mind. 

It was common in antiquity to reproach the atomists with attributing
everything to chance. They were, on the contrary, strict determinists,
who believed that everything happens in accordance with natural laws.
Democritus explicitly denied that anything can happen by chance.[^38]
Leucippus, though his existence is questioned, is known to have said
one thing: "Naught happens for nothing, but everything from a ground
and of necessity." It is true that he gave no reason why the world
should originally have been as it was; this, perhaps, might have been
attributed to chance. But when once the world existed, its further
development was unalterably fixed by mechanical principles. Aristotle
and others reproached him and Democritus for not accounting for the
original motion of the atoms, but in this the atomists were more
scientific than their critics. Causation must start from something,
and wherever it starts no cause can be assigned for the initial datum.
The world may be attributed to a Creator, but even then the Creator
Himself is unaccounted for. The theory of the atomists, in fact, was
more nearly that of modern science than any other theory propounded in
antiquity.

[^38]: See Bailey, _op. cit._, p. 121, on the determinism of Democritus.

The atomists, unlike Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle, sought to explain
the world without introducing the notion of purpose or final cause.
The "final cause" of an occurrence is an event in the future for the
sake of which the occurrence takes place. In human affairs, this
conception is applicable. Why does the baker make bread? Because
people will be hungry. Why are railways built? Because people will
wish to travel. In such cases, things are explained by the purpose
they serve. When we ask "why?" concerning an event, we may mean either
of two things. We may mean: "What purpose did this event serve?" or we
may mean: "What earlier circumstances caused this event?" The answer
to the former question is a teleological explanation, or an
explanation by final causes; the answer to the latter question is a
mechanistic explanation. I do not see how it could have been known in
advance which of these two questions science ought to ask, or whether
it ought to ask both. But experience has shown that the mechanistic
question leads to scientific knowledge, while the teleological
question does not. The atomists asked the mechanistic question, and
gave a mechanistic answer. Their successors, until the Renaissance,
were more interested in the teleological question, and thus led
science up a blind alley.

In regard to both questions alike, there is a limitation which is
often ignored, both in popular thought and in philosophy. Neither
question can be asked intelligibly about reality as a whole (including
God), but only about parts of it. As regards the teleological
explanation, it usually arrives, before long, at a Creator, or at
least an Artificer, whose purposes are realized in the course of
nature. But if a man is so obstinately teleological as to continue to
ask what purpose is served by the Creator, it becomes obvious that his
question is impious. It is, moreover, unmeaning, since, to make it
significant, we should have to suppose the Creator created by some
super-Creator whose purposes He served. The conception of purpose,
therefore, is only applicable within reality, not to reality as a
whole.

A not dissimilar argument applies to mechanistic explanations. One
event is caused by another, the other by a third, and so on. But if we
ask for a cause of the whole, we are driven again to the Creator, who
must Himself be uncaused. All causal explanations, therefore must have
an arbitrary beginning. That is why it is no defect in the theory of
the atomists to have left the original movements of the atoms
unaccounted for.

It must not be supposed that their reasons for their theories were
wholly empirical. The atomic theory was revived in modern times to
explain the facts of chemistry, but these facts were not known to the
Greeks. There was no very sharp distinction, in ancient times, between
empirical observation and logical argument. Parmenides, it is true,
treated observed facts with contempt, but Empedocles and Anaxagoras
would combine much of their metaphysics with observations on
water-clocks and whirling buckets. Until the Sophists, no philosopher
seems to have doubted that a complete metaphysic and cosmology could
be established by a combination of much reasoning and some
observation. By good luck, the atomists hit on a hypothesis for which,
more than two thousand years later, some evidence was found, but their
belief, in their day, was none the less destitute of any solid
foundation.[^39]

[^39]: On the logical and mathematical grounds for the theories of the atomists, see Gaston Mihaud, _Les Philosophes Geometres de la Greca_, chap. iv. 

Like the other philosophers of his time, Leucippus was concerned to
find a way of reconciling the arguments of Parmenides with the obvious
fact of motion and change. As Aristotle says:[^40]

[^40]: _On Generation and Corruption_, 325. 

> Although these opinions [those of Parmenides] appear to follow
> logically in a dialectical discussion, yet to believe them seems
> next door to madness when one considers the facts. For indeed no
> lunatic seems to be so far out of his senses as to suppose that fire
> and ice are "one": it is only between what is right and what seems
> right from habit that some people are mad enough to see no
> difference.

Leucippus, however, thought he had a theory which harmonized 
with sense-perception and would not abolish either coming-to-be 
and passing-away or motion and the multiplicity of things. He 
made these concessions to the facts of perception: on the other 
hand, he conceded to the Monists that there could be no motion 
without a void. The result is a theory which he states as follows: 

> The void is a not-being, and no part of what is is a not-being; for
> what is in the strict sense of the term is an absolute plenum. This
> plenum, however, is not one; on the contrary, it is a many infinite in
> number and invisible owing to the minuteness of their bulk. The many
> move in the void (for there is a void): and by coming together they
> produce coming-to-be, while by separating they produce passing-away.
> Moreover, they act and suffer action whenever they chance to be in
> contact (for there they are not one), and they generate by being put
> together and become intertwined. From the genuinely one, on the other
> hand, there could never have come to be a multiplicity, nor from the
> genuinely many a one: that is impossible.

It will be seen that there was one point on which everybody so
far was agreed, namely that there could be no motion in a plenum. 
In this, all alike were mistaken. There can be cyclic motion in a 
plenum, provided it has always existed. The idea was that a thing 
could only move into an empty place, and that, in a plenum, there 
are no empty places. It might be contended, perhaps validly, that 
motion could never begin in a plenum, but it cannot be validly 
maintained that it could not occur at all. To the Greeks, however, 
it seemed that one must either acquiesce in the unchanging world 
of Parmenides, or admit the void. 

Now the arguments of Parmenides against not-being seemed logically
irrefutable against the void, and they were reinforced by the
discovery that where there seems to be nothing there is air. (This is
an example of the confused mixture of logic and observation that was
common.) We may put the Parmenidean position in this way: "You say
there is the void; therefore the void is not nothing; therefore it is
not the void." It cannot be said that the atomists answered this
argument; they merely proclaimed that they proposed to ignore it, on
the ground that motion is a fact of experience, and therefore there
must be a void, however difficult it may be to conceive.[^41]

[^41]: Bailey (_op. cit._, p. 75) maintains, on the contrary, that Leucippus had an answer, which was "extremely subtle." It consisted essentially in admitting the existence of something (the void) which was not corporeal. Similarly Burnet says: "It is a curious fact that the Atomists, who are commonly regarded as the great materialists of antiquity, were actually the first to say distinctly that a thing might be real without being a body." 

Let us consider the subsequent history of this problem. The first and
most obvious way of avoiding the logical difficulty is to distinguish
between matter and space. According to this view, space is not
nothing, but is of the nature of a receptacle, which may or may not
have any given part filled with matter. Aristotle says (_Physics_, 208
b): "The theory that the void exists involves the existence of place:
for one would define void as place bereft of body." This view is set
forth with the utmost explicitness by Newton, who asserts the
existence of absolute space, and accordingly distinguishes absolute
from relative motion. In the Copernican controversy, both sides
(however little they may have realized it) were committed to this
view, since they thought there was a difference between saying "the
heavens revolve from cast to west" and saying "the earth rotates from
west to east." If all motion is relative, these two statements are
merely different ways of saying the same thing, like "John is the
father of James" and "James is the son of John." But if all motion is
relative, and space is not substantial, we are left with the
Parmenidean arguments against the void on our hands.

Descartes, whose arguments are of just the same sort as those of early
Greek philosophers, said that extension is the essence of matter, and
therefore there is matter everywhere. For him, extension is an
adjective, not a substantive; its substantive is matter, and without
its substantive it cannot exist. Empty space, to him, is as absurd as
happiness without a sentient being who is happy. Leibniz, on somewhat
different grounds, also believed in the plenum, but he maintained that
space is merely a system of relations. On this subject there was a
famous controversy between him and Newton, the latter represented by
Clarke. The controversy remained undecided until the time of Einstein,
whose theory conclusively gave the victory to Leibniz.

The modern physicist, while he still believes that matter is in some
sense atomic, does not believe in empty space. Where there is not
matter, there is still _something_, notably light-waves. Matter no
longer has the lofty status that it acquired in philosophy through the
arguments of Parmenides. It is not unchanging substance, but merely a
way of grouping events. Some events belong to groups that can be
regarded as material things; others, such as light-waves, do not. It
is the events that are the _stuff_ of the world, and each of them is of
brief duration. In this respect, modern physics is on the side of
Heraclitus as against Parmenides. But it was on the side of Parmenides
until Einstein and quantum theory.

As regards space, the modern view is that it is neither a substance,
as Newton maintained, and as Leucippus and Democritus ought to have
said, nor an adjective of extended bodies, as Descartes thought, but a
system of relations, as Leibniz held. It is not by any means clear
whether this view is compatible with the existence of the void.
Perhaps, as a matter of abstract logic, it can be reconciled with the
void. We might say that, between any two things, there is a certain
greater or smaller _distance_, and that distance does not imply the
existence of intermediate things. Such a point of view, however, would
be impossible to utilize in modern physics. Since Einstein, distance
is between _events_, not between _things_, and involves time as well
as space. It is essentially a causal conception, and in modern physics
there is no action at a distance. All this, however, is based upon
empirical rather than logical grounds. Moreover the modern view cannot
be stated except in terms of differential equations, and would
therefore be unintelligible to the philosophers of antiquity.

It would seem, accordingly, that the logical development of the 
views of the atomists is the Newtonian theory of absolute space, 
which meets the difficulty of attributing reality to not-being. To 
this theory there are no logical objections. The chief objection is 
that absolute space is absolutely unknowable, and cannot therefore 
be a necessary hypothesis in an empirical science. The more 
practical objection is that physics can get on without it. But the 
world of the atomists remains logically possible, and is more akin 
to the actual world than is the world of any other of the ancient 
philosophers. 

Democritus worked out his theories in considerable detail, and some of
the working-out is interesting. Each atom, he said, was impenetrable
and indivisible because it contained no void. When you use a knife to
cut an apple, the knife has to find empty places where it can
penetrate; if the apple contained no void, it would be infinitely hard
and therefore physically indivisible. Each atom is internally
unchanging, and in fact a Parmenidean One. The only things that atoms
do are to move and hit each other, and sometimes to combine when they
happen to have shapes that are capable of interlocking. They are of
all sorts of shapes; fire is composed of small spherical atoms, and so
is the soul. Atoms, by collision, produce vortices, which generate
bodies and ultimately worlds.[^42] There are many worlds, some growing,
some decaying; some may have no sun or moon, some several. Every world
has a beginning and an end. A world may be destroyed by collision
with a larger world. This cosmology may be summarized in Shelley's
words:

[^42]: On the way in which this was supposed to happen, sec Bailey, _op. cit._, p. 138 ff. 

> Worlds on worlds are rolling ever  
> From creation to decay,  
> Like the bubbles on a river  
> Sparkling bursting, borne away.  

Life developed out of the primeval slime. There is some fire
everywhere in a living body, but most in the brain or in the breast.
(On this, authorities differ.) Thought is a kind of motion, and is
thus able to cause motion elsewhere. Perception and thought are
physical processes. Perception is of two sorts, one of the senses, one
of the understanding. Perceptions of the latter sort depend only on
the things perceived, while those of the former sort depend also on
our senses, and are therefore apt to be deceptive. Like Locke,
Democritus held that such qualities as warmth, taste, and color are
not really in the object, but are due to our sense-organs, while such
qualities as weight, density, and hardness are really in the object.

Democritus was a thorough-going materialist; for him, as we have seen,
the soul was composed of atoms, and thought was a physical process.
There was no purpose in the universe; there were only atoms governed
by mechanical laws. He disbelieved in popular religion, and he argued
against the _nous_ of Anaxagoras. In ethics he considered cheerfulness
the goal of life, and regarded moderation and culture as the best
means to it. He disliked everything violent and passionate; he
disapproved of sex, because, he said, it involved the overwhelming of
consciousness by pleasure. He valued friendship, but thought ill of
women, and did not desire children, because their education interferes
with philosophy. In all this, he was very like Jeremy Bentham; he was
equally so in his love of what the Greeks called democracy.[^43]

[^43]: "Poverty in a democracy is as much to be preferred to what is called prosperity under despots as freedom is to slavery." he says. 

Democritus such, at least, is my opinion is the last of the Greek
philosophers to be free from a certain fault which vitiated all later
ancient and medieval thought. All the philosophers we have been
considering so far were engaged in a disinterested effort to
understand the world. They thought it easier to understand than it is,
but without this optimism they would not have had the courage to make
a beginning. Their attitude, in the main, was genuinely scientific
whenever it did not merely embody the prejudices of their age. But it
was not only scientific; it was imaginative and vigorous and filled
with the delight of adventure. They were interested in everything
meteors and eclipses, fishes and whirlwinds, religion and morality;
with a penetrating intellect they combined the zest of children.

From this point onwards, there are first certain seeds of decay, in
spite of previously unmatched achievement, and then a gradual
decadence. What is amiss, even in the best philosophy after
Democritus, is an undue emphasis on man as compared with the universe.
First comes skepticism, with the Sophists, leading to a study of how
we know rather than to the attempt to acquire fresh knowledge. Then
comes, with Socrates, the emphasis on ethics; with Plato, the
rejection of the world of sense in favor of the self-created world of
pure thought; with Aristotle, the belief in purpose as the fundamental
concept in science. In spite of the genius of Plato and Aristotle,
their thought has vices which proved infinitely harmful. After their
time, there was a decay of vigor, and a gradual recrudescence of
popular superstition. A partially new outlook arose as a result of the
victory of Catholic orthodoxy; but it was not until the Renaissance
that philosophy regained the vigor and independence that characterize
the predecessors of Socrates.


## Chapter X PROTAGORAS 

The great pre-Socratic systems that we have been considering were
confronted, in the latter half of the fifth century, by a skeptical
movement, in which the most important figure was Protagoras, chief of
the Sophists. The word "Sophist" had originally no bad connotation; it
meant, as nearly as may be, what we mean by "professor." A Sophist was
a man who made his living by teaching young men certain things that,
it was thought, would be useful to them in practical life. As there
was no public provision for such education, the Sophists taught only
those who had private means, or whose parents had. This tended to give
them a certain class bias, which was increased by the political
circumstances of the time. In Athens and many other cities, democracy
was politically triumphant, but nothing had been done to diminish the
wealth of those who belonged to the old aristocratic families. It was,
in the main, the rich who embodied what appears to us as Hellenic
culture: they had education and leisure, travel had taken the edge off
their traditional prejudices, and the time that they spent in
discussion sharpened their wits. What was called democracy did not
touch the institution of slavery, which enabled the rich to enjoy
their wealth without oppressing free citizens.

In many cities, however, and especially in Athens, the poorer citizens
had towards the rich a double hostility, that of envy, and that of
traditionalism. The rich were supposed often with justice to be
impious and immoral; they were subverting ancient beliefs, and
probably trying to destroy democracy. It thus happened that political
democracy, was associated with cultural conservatism, while those who
were cultural innovators tended to be political reactionaries.
Somewhat the same situation exists in modern America, where Tammany,
as a mainly Catholic organization, is engaged in defending traditional
theological and ethical dogmas against the assaults of enlightenment.
But the enlightened are politically weaker in America than they were
in Athens, because they have failed to make common cause with the
plutocracy. There is, however, one important and highly intellectual
class which is concerned with the defense of the plutocracy, namely
the class of corporation lawyers. In same respects, their functions
are similar to those that were performed in Athens by the Sophists.

Athenian democracy, though it had the grave limitation of not
including slaves or women, was in some respects more democratic than
any modern system. Judges and most executive officers were chosen by
lot, and served for short periods; they were thus average citizens,
like our jurymen, with the prejudices and lack of professionalism
characteristic of average citizens. In general, there were a large
number of judges to hear each case. The plaintiff and defendant, or
prosecutor and accused, appeared in person, not through professional
lawyers. Naturally, success or failure depended largely on oratorical
skill in appealing to popular prejudices. Although a man had to
deliver his own speech, he could hire an expert to write the speech
for him, or, as many preferred, he could pay for instruction in the
arts required for success in the law courts. These arts the Sophists
were supposed to teach.

The age of Pericles is analogous, in Athenian history, to the
Victorian age in the history of England. Athens was rich and powerful,
not much troubled by wars, and possessed of a democratic constitution
administered by aristocrats. As we have seen, in connection with
Anaxagoras, a democratic opposition to Pericles gradually gathered
strength, and attacked his friends one by one. The Peloponnesian War
broke out in 431 BC;[^44] Athens (in common with many other places)
was ravaged by the plague; the population, which had been about
230,000, was greatly reduced, and never rose again to its former level
(Bury, _History of Greece_, I, p. 444). Pericles himself, in 430 BC,
was deposed from the office of general and fined for misappropriation
of public money, but soon reinstated. His two legitimate sons died of
the plague, and he himself died in the following year (429). Pheidias
and Anaxagoras were condemned; Aspasia was prosecuted for impiety
and for keeping a disorderly house, but acquitted.

[^44]: It ended in 404 BC with the complete overthrow of Athens. 

In such a community, it was natural that men who were likely to incur
the hostility of democratic politicians should wish to acquire
forensic skill. For Athens, though much addicted to persecution, was
in one respect less illiberal than modern America, since those accused
of impiety and corrupting the young were allowed to plead in their own
defense.

This explains the popularity of the Sophists with one class and their
unpopularity with another. But in their own minds they served more
impersonal purposes, and it is clear that many of them were genuinely
concerned with philosophy. Plato devoted himself to caricaturing and
vilifying them, but they must not be judged by his polemics. In his
lighter vein, take the following passage from the Eutkydemus, in which
two Sophists, Dionysodorus and Euthydemus, set to work to puzzle a
simple-minded person named Clesippus. Dionysodorus begins:

> You say that you have a dog?  
> Yes, a villain of a one, said Clesippus.  
> And he has puppies?  
> Yes, and they are very like himself.  
> And the dog is the father of them?  
> Yes, he said, I certainly saw him and the mother of the puppies come together.  
> And is he not yours?  
> To be sure he is.  
> Then he is a father, and he is yours; ergo, he is your father, and the puppies are your brothers.  

In a more serious vein, take the dialogue called _The Sophist_. 
This is a logical discussion of definition, which uses the sophist 
as an illustration. With its logic we are not at present concerned; 
the only thing I wish to mention at the moment as regards this

There is a story about Protagoras, no doubt apocryphal, which 
illustrates the connection of the Sophists with the law-courts in 
the popular mind. It is said that he taught a young man on the 
terms that he should be paid his fee if the young man won 
his first law-suit, but not otherwise, and that the young man's 
first law-suit was one brought by Protagoras for recovery of 
his fee. 

However, it is time to leave these preliminaries and see what is 
really known about Protagoras. 

Protagoras was born about 500 BC, at Abdera, the city from 
which Democritus came. He twice visited Athens, his second visit 
being not later than 432 BC He made a code of laws for the city 
of Thurii in 444-3 BC. There is a tradition that he was prosecuted 
for impiety, but this seems to be untrue, in spite of the fact that 
he wrote a book _On the Gods_, which began: "With regard to the 
gods, I cannot feel sure either that they are or that they are not, 
nor what they are like in figure; for there are many things that 
hinder sure knowledge, the obscurity of the subject and the 
shortness of human life." 

His second visit to Athens is described somewhat satirically in 
Plato's _Protagoras_, and his doctrines are discussed seriously in 
the _Theaetetus_. He is chiefly noted for his doctrine that "Man is 
the measure of all things, of things that are that they are, and of 
things that are not that they are not." This is interpreted as 
meaning that each man is the measure of all things, and that, 
when men differ, there is no objective truth in virtue of which 
one is right and the other wrong. The doctrine is essentially 
skeptical, and is presumably based on the "deceitfulness" of the 
senses. 

One of the three founders of pragmatism, F. C. S. Schiller, was in the
habit of calling himself a disciple of Protagoras. This was, I think,
because Plato, in the _Theaetetus_, suggests, as an interpretation of
Protagoras, that one opinion can be better than another, though it
cannot be truer. For example, when a man has jaundice everything looks
yellow. There is no sense in saying that things are really not yellow,
but the color they look to a man in health; we can say, however,
that, since health is better than sickness, the opinion of the man in
health is better than that of the man who has jaundice. This point of
view, obviously, is akin to pragmatism.

The disbelief in objective truth makes the majority, for practical 
purposes, the arbiters as to what to believe. Hence Protagoras was 
led to a defense of law and convention and traditional morality. 
While, as we saw, he did not know whether the gods existed, he 
was sure they ought to be worshipped. This point of view is 
obviously the right one for a man whose theoretical skepticism is 
thoroughgoing and logical. 

Protagoras spent his adult life in a sort of perpetual lecture tour
through the cities of Greece, teaching, for a fee, "any one who
desired practical efficiency and higher mental culture" (Zeller, p.
1299). Plato objects somewhat snobbishly, according to modern notions
to the Sophists' practice of charging money for instruction. Plato
himself had adequate private means, and was unable, apparently, to
realize the necessities of those who had not his good fortune. It is
odd that modern professors, who see no reason to refuse a salary, have
so frequently repeated Plato's strictures.

There was, however, another point in which the Sophists differed from
most contemporary philosophers. It was usual, except among the
Sophists, for a teacher to found a school, which had some of the
properties of a brotherhood; there was a greater or smaller amount of
common life, there was often something analogous to a monastic rule,
and there was usually an esoteric doctrine not proclaimed to the
public. All this was natural wherever philosophy had arisen out of
Orphism. Among the Sophists there was none of this. What they had to
teach was not, in their minds, connected with religion or virtue. They
taught the art of arguing, and as much knowledge as would help in this
an. Broadly speaking, they were prepared, like modern lawyers, to show
how to argue for or against any opinion, and were not concerned to
advocate conclusions of their own. Those to whom philosophy was a way
of life, closely bound up with religion, were naturally shocked; to
them, the Sophists appeared frivolous and immoral.

To some extent---though it is impossible to say how far---the odium
which the Sophists incurred, not only with the general public, but
with Plato and subsequent philosophers, was due to their intellectual
merit. The pursuit of truth, when it is whole-hearted, must ignore
moral considerations; we cannot know in advance that the truth will
turn out to be what is thought edifying in a given society. The
Sophists were prepared to follow an argument wherever it might lead
them. Often it led them to skepticism. One of them, Gorgias,
maintained that nothing exists; that if anything exists, it is
unknowable; and granting it even to exist and la be knowable by any
one man, he could never communicate it to others. We do not know what
hLs arguments were, but I can well imagine that they had a logical
force which compelled his opponents to take refuge in edification.
Plato is always concerned to advocate views that will make people what
he thinks virtuous; he is hardly ever intellectually honest, because
he allows himself to judge doctrines by their social consequences.
Even about this, he is not honest; he pretends to follow the argument
and to be judging by purely theoretical standards, when in fact he is
twisting the discussion so as to lead to a virtuous result. He
introduced this vice into philosophy, where it has persisted ever
since. It was probably largely hostility to the Sophists that gave
this, character to his dialogues. One of the defects of all
philosophers since Plato is that their inquiries into ethics proceed
on the assumption that they already know the conclusions to be
reached.

It seems that there were men, in the Athens of the late fifth 
century, who taught political doctrines which seemed immoral to 
their contemporaries, and seem so to the democratic nations of 
the present day. Thrasymachus, in the first book of the _Republic_, 
argues that there is no justice except the interest of the stronger; 
that laws are made by governments for their own advantage; and 
that there is no impersonal standard to which to appeal in contests 
for power, Callicles, according to Plato (in the _Gorgias_), maintained 
a similar doctrine. The law of nature, he said, is the law of the 
stronger; but for convenience men have established institutions 
and moral precepts to restrain the strong. Such doctrines have 
won much wider assent in our day than they did in antiquity. 
And whatever may be thought of them, they are not characteristic 
of the Sophists. 

During the fifth century---whatever part the Sophists may have had in
the change---there was in Athens a transformation from a certain stiff
Puritan simplicity to a quick-witted and rather cruel cynicism in
conflict with a slow-witted and equally cruel defense of crumbling
orthodoxy. At the beginning of the century comes the Athenian
championship of the cities of Ionia against the Persians, and the
victory of Marathon in 490 BC. At the end comes the defeat of Athens
by Sparta in 404 BC, and the execution of Socrates in 399 BC. After
this time Athens ceased to be politically important, but acquired
undoubted cultural supremacy, which it retained until the victory of
Christianity.

Something of the history of fifth-century Athens is essential to
the understanding of Plato and of all subsequent Greek thought.
In the first Persian war, the chief glory went to the Athenians,
owing to the decisive victory at Marathon. In the second war, ten
years later, the Athenians still were the best of the Greeks at sea,
but on land victory was mainly due to the Spartans, who were the 
acknowledged leaders of the Hellenic world. The Spartans, however, were narrowly provincial in their outlook, and ceased to 
oppose the Persians when they had been chased out of European 
Greece. The championship of the Asiatic Greeks, and the liberation of the islands that had been conquered by the Persians, was 
undertaken, with great success, by Athens. Athens became the 
leading sea power, and acquired a considerable imperialist control 
over the Ionian islands. Under the leadership of Pericles, who was 
a moderate democrat and a moderate imperialist, Athens prospered. 
The great temples, whose ruins are still the glory of Athens, were 
built by his initiative, to replace those destroyed by Xerxes. The 
city increased very rapidly in wealth, and also in culture, and, as 
invariably happens at such times, particularly when wealth is due 
to foreign commerce, traditional morality and traditional beliefs 
decayed. 

There was at this time in Athens an extraordinarily large number of
men of genius. The three great dramatists, Aeschylus, Sophocles, and
Euripides, all belong to the fifth century. Aeschylus fought at
Marathon and saw the battle of Salamis. Sophocles was still
religiously orthodox. But Euripides was influenced by Protagoras and
by the free-thinking spirit of the time, and his treatment of the
myths is skeptical and subversive. Aristophanes, the comic poet, made
fun of Socrates, Sophists, and philosophers, but, nevertheless,
belonged to their circle; in the Symposium Plato represents him as on
very friendly terms with Socrates. Pheidias the sculptor, as we have
seen, belonged to the circle of Pericles.

The excellence of Athens, at this period, was artistic rather 
than intellectual. None of the great mathematicians or philosophers 
of the fifth century were Athenians, with the exception of Socrates; 
and Socrates was not a writer, but a man who confined himself 
to oral discussion. 

The outbreak of the Peloponncsian War in 431 BC and the
death of Pericles in 429 BC introduced a darker period in Athenian 
history. The Athenians were superior at sea, but the Spartans 
had supremacy on land, and repeatedly occupied Attica (except 
Athens) during the summer. The result was that Athens was over-crowded, and suffered severely from the plague. In 414 BC the 
Athenians sent a large expedition to Sicily, in the hope of capturing 
Syracuse, which was allied with Sparta; but the attempt was a 
failure. War made the Athenians fierce and persecuting. In 416 BC 
they conquered the island of Melos, put to death all men of 
military age and enslaved the other inhabitants. _The Trojan 
Women_ of Euripides is a protest against such barbarism. The 
conflict had an ideological aspect, since Sparta was the champion 
of oligarchy and Athens of democracy. The Athenians had reason 
to suspect some of their own aristocrats of treachery, which was 
generally thought to have had a part in the final naval defeat at 
the battle of Aegospotami in 405 BC.

At the end of the war, the Spartans established in Athens an 
oligarchical government, known as the Thirty Tyrants. Some of 
the Thirty, including Critias, their chief, had been pupils of 
Socrates. They were deservedly unpopular, and were overthrown 
within a year. With the compliance of Sparta, democracy was 
restored, but it was an embittered democracy, precluded by an 
amnesty from direct vengeance against its internal enemies, but 
glad of any pretext, not covered by the amnesty, for prosecuting 
them. It was in this atmosphere that the trial and death of Socrates 
took place (399 BC). 


# Part 2. Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle 

## Chapter XI SOCRATES 

Socrates is a very difficult subject for the historian. There are many
men concerning whom it is certain that very little is known, and other
men concerning whom it is certain that a great deal is known; but in
the case of Socrates the uncertainty is as to whether we know very
little or a great deal. He was undoubtedly an Athenian citizen of
moderate means, who spent his time in disputation, and taught
philosophy to the young, but not for money, like the Sophists. He was
certainly tried, condemned to death, and executed in 399 BC, at about
the ape of seventy. He was unquestionably a well-known figure in
Athens, since Aristophanes caricatured him in _The Clouds_. But beyond
this point we become involved in controversy. Two of his pupils,
Xenophon and Plato, wrote voluminously about him, but they said very
different things. Even when they agree, it has been suggested by
Burnet that Xenophon is copying Plato. Where they disagree, some
believe the one, some the other, some neither. In such a dangerous
dispute, I shall not venture to take sides, but I will set out briefly
the various points of view.

Let us begin with Xenophon, a military man, not very liberally 
endowed with brains, and on the whole conventional in his outlook. Xenophon is pained that Socrates should have been accused 
of impiety and of corrupting the youth; he contends that, on the 
contrary, Socrates was eminently pious and had a thoroughly 
wholesome effect upon those who came under his influence. His 
ideas, it appears, so far from being subversive, were rather dull 
and commonplace. This defense goes too far, since it leaves the 
hostility to Socrates unexplained. As Burnet says (_Thales to Plato_, 
p. 149): "Xenophon's defense of Socrates is too successful. He 
would never have been put to death if he had been like that." 

There has been a tendency to think that everything Xenophon says must
be true, because he had not the wits to think of anything untrue. This
is a very invalid line of argument. A stupid man's report of what a
clever man says is never accurate, because he unconsciously translates
what he hears into something that he can understand. I would rather be
reported by my bitterest enemy among philosophers than by a friend
innocent of philosophy. We cannot therefore accept what Xenophon says
if it either involves any difficult point in philosophy or is part of
an argument to prove that Socrates was unjustly condemned.

Nevertheless, some of Xenophon's reminiscences are very convincing. He
tells (as Plato also does) how Socrates was continually occupied with
the problem of getting competent men into positions of power. He would
ask such questions as: "If I wanted a shoe mended, whom should I
employ?" To which some ingenuous youth would answer: "A shoemaker, O
Socrates." He would go on to carpenters, coppersmiths, etc., and
finally ask some such question as "who should mend the Ship of State?"
When he fell into conflict with the Thirty Tyrants, Critias, their
chief, who knew his ways from having studied under him, forbade him to
continue teaching the young, and added: "You had better be done with
your shoemakers, carpenters, and coppersmiths. These must be pretty
well trodden out at heel by this time, considering the circulation you
have given them" (Xenophon, Memorabilia, Ilk. I, chap. ii). This
happened during the brief oligarchic government established by the
Spartans at the end of the Peloponnesian War. But at most times Athens
was democratic, so much so that even generals were elected or chosen
by lot. Socrates came across a young man who wished to become a
general, and persuaded him that it would be well to know something of
the art of war. The young man accordingly went away and took a brief
course in tactics. When he returned, Socrates, after some satirical
praise, sent him back for further instruction (ibid., Bk. Ill, chap.
i). Another young man he set to learning the principles of finance. He
tried the same sort of plan on many people, including the war
minister; but it was decided that it was easier to silence him by
means of the hemlock than to cure the evils of which he complained.

With Plato's account of Socrates, the difficulty is quite a different
one from what it is in the case of Xenophon, namely, that it is very
hard to judge how far Plato means to portray the historical Socrates,
and how far he intends the person called "Socrates" in his dialogues
to be merely the mouthpiece of his own opinions. Plato, in addition to
being a philosopher, is an imaginative writer of great genius and
charm. No one supposes, and he himself does not seriously pretend,
that the conversations in his dialogues took place just as he records
them. Nevertheless, at any rate in the earlier dialogues, the
conversation is completely natural and the characters quite
convincing. It is the excellence of Plato as a writer of fiction that
throws doubt on him as a historian. His Socrates is a consistent and
extraordinarily interesting character, far beyond the power of most
men to invent; but I think Plato could have invented him. Whether he
did so is of course another question.

The dialogue which is most generally regarded as historical is the
Apology. This professes to be the speech that Socrates made in his own
defense at his trial not, of course, a stenographic report, but what
remained in Plato's memory some years after the event, put together
and elaborated with literary art. Plato was present at the trial, and
it certainly seems fairly clear that what is set down is the sort of
thing that Plato remembered Socrates as saying, and that the intention
is, broadly speaking, historical. This, with all its limitations, is
enough to give a fairly definite picture of the character of Socrates.

The main facts of the trial of Socrates are not open to doubt. The
prosecution was based upon the charge that "Socrates is an evil-doer
and a curious person, searching into things under the earth and above
the heaven; and making the worse appear the better cause, and teaching
all this to others." The real ground of hostility to him was, almost
certainly, that he was supposed to be connected with the aristocratic
party; most of his pupils belonged to this faction, and some, in
positions of power, had proved themselves very pernicious. But this
ground could not be made evident, on account of the amnesty. He was
found guilty by a majority, and it was then open to him, by Athenian
law, to propose some lesser penalty than death. The judges had to
choose, if they had found the accused guilty, between the penalty
demanded by the prosecution and that suggested by the defense. It was
therefore to the interest of Socrates to suggest a substantial
penalty, which the court might have accepted as adequate. He, however,
proposed a fine of thirty minae, for which some of his friends
(including Plato) were willing to go surety. This was so small a
punishment that the court was annoyed, and condemned him to death by a
larger majority than that which had found him guilty. Undoubtedly he
foresaw this result. It is clear that he had no wish to avoid the
death penalty by concessions which might seem to acknowledge his
guilt.

The prosecutors were Anytus, a democratic politician; Meletus, a
tragic poet, "youthful and unknown, with lanky hair, and scanty beard,
and a hooked nose"; and Lykon, an obscure rhetorician. (See Burnet,
_Thales to Plato_, p. 180.) They maintained that Socrates was guilty
of not worshipping the gods the State worshipped but introducing other
new divinities, and further that he was guilty of corrupting the young
by teaching them accordingly.

Without further troubling ourselves with the insoluble question of the
relation of the Platonic Socrates to the real man, let us see what
Plato makes him say in answer to this charge.

Socrates begins by accusing his prosecutors of eloquence, and 
rebutting the charge of eloquence as applied to himself. The only 
eloquence of which he is capable, he says, is that of truth. And 
they must not be angry with him if he speaks in his accustomed 
manner, not in "a set oration, duly ornamented with words and 
phrases."[^45] He is over seventy, and has never appeared in a court 
of law until now; they must therefore pardon his un-forensic way 
of speaking.

[^45]: In quotations from Plato, I have generally used Jowett's translation. 


He goes on to say that, in addition to his formal accusers, he has a
large body of informal accusers, who, ever since the judges were
children, have gone about "telling of one Socrates, a wise man, who
speculated about the heavens above, and searched into the earth
beneath, and made the worse appear the better cause." Such men, he
says, are supposed not to believe in the existence of the gods. This
old accusation by public opinion is more dangerous than the formal
indictment, the more so as he does not know who are the men from whom
it comes, except in the case of Aristophanes.[^46] He points out, in
reply to these older grounds of hostility, that he is not a man of
science "I have nothing to do with physical speculations" that he is
not a teacher, and does not take money for teaching. He goes on to
make fun of the Sophists, and to disclaim the knowledge that they
profess to have. What, then, is "the reason why I am called wise and
have such an evil fame?"


[^46]: In _The Clouds_, Socrates is represented as denying the existence of Zeus.

The oracle of Delphi, it appears, was once asked if there were any man
wiser than Socrates, and replied that there was not. Socrates
professes to have been completely puzzled, since he knew nothing, and
yet a god cannot lie. He therefore went about among men reputed wise,
to see whether he could convict the god of error. First he went to a
politician, who "was thought wise by many, and still wiser by
himself." He soon found that the man was not wise, and explained this
to him, kindly but firmly, "and the consequence was that he hated me."
He then went to the poets, and asked them to explain passages in their
writings, but they were unable to do so. "Then I knew that not by
wisdom do poets write poetry, but by a sort of genius and
inspiration." Then he went to the artisans, but found them equally
disappointing. In the process, he says, he made many dangerous
enemies. Finally he concluded that "God only is wise; and by his
answer he intends to show that the wisdom of men is worth little or
nothing; he is not speaking of Socrates, he is only using my name by
way of illustration, as if he said, He, O men, is the wisest, who,
like Socrates, knows that his wisdom is in truth worth nothing." This
business of showing up pretenders to wisdom takes up all his time, and
has left him in utter poverty, but he feels it a duty to vindicate the
oracle.

Young men of the richer classes, he says, having not much to 
do, enjoy listening to him exposing people, and proceed to do 
likewise, thus increasing the number of his enemies. "For they 
do not like to confess that their pretense of knowledge has been 
detected." 

So much for the first class of accusers. 

Socrates now proceeds to examine his prosecutor Meletus, "that 
good man and true lover of his country, as he calls himself." He 
asks who are the people who improve the young. Meletus first 
mentions the judges; then, under pressure, is driven, step by step, 
to say that every Athenian except Socrates improves the young; 
whereupon Socrates congratulates the city on its good fortune. 
Next, he points out that good men are better to live among than 
bad men, and therefore he cannot be so foolish as to corrupt his 
fellow-citizens intentionally; but if unintentionally, then Meletus 
should instruct him, not prosecute him. 

The indictment had said that Socrates not only denied the gods of the
State, but introduced other gods of his own; Meletus, however, says
that Socrates is a complete atheist, and adds: "He says that the sun
is stone and the moon earth." Socrates replies that Meletus seems to
think he is prosecuting Anaxagoras, whose views may be heard in the
theatre for one drachma (presumably in the plays of Euripides).
Socrates of course points out that this new accusation of complete
atheism contradicts the indictment, and then passes on to more general
considerations.

The rest of the Apology is essentially religious in tone. He has been
a soldier, and has remained at his post, as he was ordered to do. Now
"God orders me to fulfill the philosopher's mission of searching into
myself and other men," and it would be as shameful to desert his post
now as in time of battle. Fear of death is not wisdom, since no one
knows whether death may not be the greater good. If he were offered
his life on condition of ceasing to speculate as he has done hitherto,
he would reply: "Men of Athens, I honor and love you; but I shall
obey God rather than you,[^47] and while I have life and strength I
shall never cease from the practice and teaching of philosophy,
exhorting any one whom I meet.... For know that this is the command of
God; and I believe that no greater good has ever happened in the State
than my service to the God." He goes on:

[^47]: Cf. _Acts_, V, 29. 

I have something more to say, at which you may be inclined to cry
out; but I believe that to hear me will be good for you, and
therefore I beg that you will not cry out. I would have you know, that
if you kill such a one as I am, you will injure yourselves more than
you will injure me. Nothing will injure me, not Meletus nor yet Anytus
they cannot, for a bad man is not permitted to injure a belter than
himself. I do not deny that Anytus may perhaps kill him, or drive him
into exile, or deprive him of civil rights; and he may imagine, and
others may imagine, that he is inflicting a great injury upon him: but
there I do not agree. For the evil of doing as he is doing the evil of
unjustly taking away the life of another is greater far.

It is for the sake of his judges, he says, not for his own sake, 
that he is pleading. He is a gad-fly, given to the State by God, and 
it will not be easy to find another like him. "I dare say you may 
feel out of temper (like a person who is suddenly awakened from 
sleep), and you think that you might easily strike me dead as 
Anytus advises, and then you would sleep on for the remainder 
of your lives, unless God in his care of you sent you another 
gad-fly." 

Why has he only gone about in private, and not given advice on public
affairs? "You have heard me speak at sundry times and in diverse
places of an oracle or sign which comes to me, and is the divinity
which Meletus ridicules in the indictment. This sign, which is a kind
of voice, first began to come to me when I was a child; it always
forbids but never commands me to do anything which I am going to do.
This is what deters me from being a politician." He goes on to say
that in politics no honest man can live long. He gives two instances
in which he was unavoidably mixed up in public affairs: in the first,
he resisted the democracy; in the second, the Thirty Tyrants, in each
case when the authorities were acting illegally.

He points out that among those present are many former pupils 
of his, and fathers and brothers of pupils; not one of these has 
been produced by the prosecution to testify that he corrupts the 
young. (This is almost the only argument in the Apology that a 
lawyer for the defense would sanction.) He refuses to follow the 
custom of producing his weeping children in court, to soften the 
hearts of the judges; such scenes, he says, make the accused and 
the city alike ridiculous. It is his business to convince the judges, 
not to ask a favor of them. 

After the verdict, and the rejection of the alternative penalty of 
thirty minae (in connection with which Socrates names Plato as 
one among his sureties, and present in court), he makes one final 
speech. 

> And now, O men who have condemned me, I would fain 
> prophesy to you; for I am about to die, and in the hour of death 
> men are gifted with prophetic power. And I prophesy to you, 
> who are my murderers, that immediately after my departure 
> punishment far heavier than you have inflicted on me will surely 
> await you.... If you think that by killing men you can prevent 
> some one from censuring your evil lives, you are mistaken; that 
> is not a way of escape which is either possible or honorable; 
> the easiest and the noblest way is not to be disabling others, but 
> to be improving yourselves. 

He then turns to those of his judges who have voted for acquittal, and
tells them that, in all that he has done that day, his oracle has
never opposed him, though on other occasions it has often stopped him
in the middle of a speech. This, he says, "is an intimation that what
has happened to me is a good, and that those of us who think death is
an evil are in error." For either death is a dreamless sleep which is
plainly good or the soul migrates to another world. And "what would
not a man give if he might converse with Orpheus and Musaeus and
Hesiod and Homer? Nay, if this be true, let me die and die again." In
the next world, he will converse with others who have suffered death
unjustly, and, above all, lie will continue his search after
knowledge. "In another world they do not put a man to death for asking
questions: assuredly not. For besides being happier than we are, they
will be immortal, if what is said is true....

"The hour of departure has arrived, and we go our ways I to die, and
you to live. Which is better God only knows."

The _Apology_ gives a clear picture of a man of a certain type: a man
very sure of himself, high-minded, indifferent to worldly success,
believing that he is guided by a divine voice, and persuaded that
clear thinking is the most important requisite for right living.
Except in this last point, he resembles a Christian martyr or a
Puritan. In the final passage, where he considers what happens after
death, it is impossible not to feel that he firmly believes in
immortality, and that his professed uncertainty is only assumed. He is
not troubled, like the Christians, by fears of eternal torment: he has
no doubt that his life in the next world will be a happy one. In the
_Phaedo_, the Platonic Socrates gives reasons for the belief in
immortality; whether these were the reasons that influenced the
historical Socrates, it is impossible to say.

There seems hardly any doubt that the historical Socrates 
claimed to be guided by an oracle or _daimon_. Whether this was 
analogous to what a Christian would call the voice of conscience, 
or whether it appeared to him as an actual voice, it is impossible 
to know. Joan of Arc was inspired by voices, which are a common 
symptom of insanity. Socrates was liable to cataleptic trances; at 
least, that seems the natural explanation of such an incident as 
occurred once when he was on military service: 

> One morning he was thinking about something which he could 
> not resolve; he would not give it up, but continued thinking from 
> early dawn until noon there he stood fixed in thought; and at 
> noon attention was drawn to him, and the rumor ran through 
> the wondering crowd that Socrates had been standing and thinking 
> about something ever since the break of day. At last, in the 
> evening after supper, some Ionians out of curiosity (I should 
> explain that this occurred not in winter but in summer), brought 
> out their mats and slept in the open air that they might watch 
> him and see whether he would stand all night. There he stood 
> until the following morning; and with the return of light he 
> offered up a prayer to the sun, and went his way (Symposium, 220). 

This sort of thing, in a lesser degree, was a common occurrence 
with Socrates. At the beginning of the Symposium, Socrates and 
Aristodemus go together to the banquet, but Socrates drops behind 
in a fit of abstraction. When Aristodemus arrives, Agathon, the 
host, says "what have you done with Socrates?" Aristodemus is 
astonished to find Socrates not with him; a slave is sent to look 
for him, and finds him in the portico of a neighboring house. 
"There he is fixed," says the slave on his return, "and when I 
call to him he will not stir." Those who know him well explain 
that "he has a way of stopping anywhere and losing himself 
without any reason." They leave him alone, and he enters when 
the feast is half over. 

Every one is agreed that Socrates was very ugly; he had a snub nose
and a considerable paunch; he was "uglier than all the Silenuses in
the Satyric drama" (Xenophon, Symposium). He was always dressed in
shabby old clothes, and went barefoot everywhere. His indifference to
heat and cold, hunger and thirst, amazed every one. Alcihiades in the
Symposium, describing Socrates on military service, says:

> His endurance was simply marvellous when, being cut off from our
> supplies, we were compelled to go without food---on such occasions,
> which often happen in time of war, he was superior not only to me
> but to everybody: there was no one to be compared to him.... His
> fortitude in enduring cold was also surprising. There was a severe
> frost, for the winter in that region is really tremendous, and
> everybody else either remained indoors or if they went out had on an
> amazing quantity of clothes, and were well shod, and had their feet
> swathed in felt and fleeces: in the midst of this, Socrates with his
> bare feet on the ice and in his ordinary dress marched better than
> the other soldiers who had shoes and they looked daggers at him
> because he seemed to despise them.

His mastery over all bodily passions is constantly stressed. He 
seldom drank wine, but when he did, he could out-drink anybody; 
no one had ever seen him drunk. In love, even under the strongest 
temptations, he remained "Platonic," if Plato is speaking the truth. 
He was the perfect Orphic saint: in the dualism of heavenly soul 
and earthly body, he had achieved the complete mastery of the 
soul over the body. His indifference to death at the last is the 
final proof of this mastery. At the same time, he is not an orthodox 
Orphic; it is only the fundamental doctrines that he accepts, not 
the superstitions and ceremonies of purification. 

The Platonic Socrates anticipates both the Stoics and the Cynics. The
Stoics held that the supreme good is virtue, and that a man cannot be
deprived of virtue by outside causes; this doctrine is implicit in the
contention of Socrates that his judges cannot harm him. The Cynics
despised worldly goods, and showed their contempt by eschewing the
comforts of civilization; this is the same point of view that led
Socrates to go barefoot and ill-clad.

It seems fairly certain that the preoccupations of Socrates were
ethical rather than scientific. In the _Apology_, as we saw, he says:
"I have nothing to do with physical speculations." The earliest of the
Platonic dialogues, which are generally supposed to be the most
Socratic, are mainly occupied with the search for definitions of
ethical terms. The _Charmides_ is concerned with the definition of
temperance or moderation; the _Lysis_ with friendship; the _Laches_
with courage. In all of these, no conclusion is arrived at, but
Socrates makes it clear that he thinks it important to examine such
questions. The Platonic Socrates consistently maintains that fie knows
nothing, and is only wiser than others in knowing that he knows
nothing; but he does not think knowledge unobtainable. On the
contrary, he thinks the search for knowledge of the utmost importance.
He maintains that no man sins wittingly, and therefore only knowledge
is needed to make all men perfectly virtuous.

The close connection between virtue and knowledge is characteristic of Socrates and Plato. To some degree, it exists in all 
Greek thought, as opposed to that of Christianity. In Christian 
ethics, a pure heart is the essential, and is at least as likely to be 
found among the ignorant as among the learned. This difference 
between Greek and Christian ethics has persisted down to the 
present day.

Dialectic, that is to say, the method of seeking knowledge by 
question and answer, was not invented by Socrates. It seems to 
have been first practiced systematically by Zeno, the disciple of 
Parmenides; in Plato's dialogue _Parmenides_, Zeno subjects Socrates 
to the same kind of treatment to which, elsewhere in Plato, 
Socrates subjects others. But there is every reason to suppose that 
Socrates practiced and developed the method. As we saw, when 
Socrates is condemned to death he reflects happily that in the 
next world he can go on asking questions for ever, and cannot be 
put to death, as he will be immortal. Certainly, if he practiced 
dialectic in the way described in the _Apology_, the hostility to him 
is easily explained: all the humbugs in Athens would combine 
against him. 

The dialectic method is suitable for some questions, and unsuitable
for others. Perhaps this helped to determine the character of Plato's
inquiries, which were, for the most part, such as could be dealt with
in this way. And through Plato's influence, most subsequent philosophy
has been bounded by the limitations resulting from his method.

Some matters are obviously unsuitable for treatment in this way
empirical science, for example. It is true that Galileo used dialogues
to advocate his theories, but that was only in order to overcome
prejudice the positive grounds for his discoveries could not be
inserted in a dialogue without great artificiality. Socrates, in
Plato's works, always pretends that he is only eliciting knowledge
already possessed by the man he is questioning; on this ground, he
compares himself to a midwife. When, in the _Phaedo_ and the _Meno_,
he applies his method to geometrical problems, he has to ask leading
questions which any judge would disallow. The method is in harmony
with the doctrine of reminiscence, according to which we learn by
remembering what we knew in a former existence. As against this view,
consider any discovery that has been made by means of the microscope,
say the spread of diseases by bacteria; it can hardly be maintained
that such knowledge can be elicited from a previously ignorant person
by the method of question and answer.

The matters that are suitable for treatment by the Socratic 
method are those as to which we have already enough knowledge 
to come to a right conclusion, but have failed, through confusion 
of thought or lack of analysis, to make the best logical use of what 
we know. A question such as "what is justice?'' is eminently suited 
for discussion in a Platonic dialogue. We all freely use the words 
"just" and "unjust," and, by examining the ways in which we 
use them, we can arrive inductively at the definition that will best 
suit with usage. All that is needed is knowledge of how the words 
in question are used. But when our inquiry is concluded, we have 
made only a linguistic discovery, not a discovery in ethics. 

We can, however, apply the method profitably to a somewhat larger
class of cases. Wherever what is being debated is logical rather than
factual, discussion is a good method of eliciting truth. Suppose
someone maintains, for example, that democracy is good, but persons
holding certain opinions should not be allowed to vote, we may convict
him of inconsistency, and prove to him that at least one of his two
assertions must be more or less erroneous. Logical errors are, I
think, of greater practical importance than many people believe; they
enable their perpetrators to hold the comfortable opinion on every
subject in turn. Any logically coherent body of doctrine is sure to be
in part painful and contrary to current prejudices. The dialectic
method or, more generally, the habit of unfettered discussion tends to
promote logical consistency, and is in this way useful. But it is
quite unavailing when the object is to discover new facts. Perhaps
"philosophy" might he defined as the sum-total of those inquiries that
can he pursued by Plato's methods. But if this definition is
appropriate, that is because of Plato's influence upon subsequent
philosophers.

## Chapter XII THE INFLUENCE OF SPARTA 

To understand Plato, and indeed many later philosophers, 
it is necessary to know something of Sparta. Sparta had 
a double effect on Greek thought: through the reality, and 
through the myth. Each is important. The reality enabled the 
Spartans to defeat Athens in war; the myth influenced Plato's 
political theory, and that of countless subsequent writers. The 
myth, fully developed, is to be found in Plutarch's _Life of Lycurgus_; 
the ideals that it favors have had a great part in framing the 
doctrines of Rousseau, Nietzsche, and National Socialism.[^48] The 
myth is of even more importance, historically, than the reality; 
nevertheless, we will begin with the latter. For the reality was the 
source of the myth. 

[^48]: Not to mention Dr. Thomas Arnold and the English public schools. 

Laconia, of which Sparta, or Lacedaemon was the capital, occupied the
south-east of the Peloponnesus. The Spartans, who were the ruling
race, had conquered the country at the time of the Dorian invasion
from the north, and had reduced the population that they found there
to the condition of serfs. These serfs were called helots. In
historical times, all the land belonged to the Spartans, who, however,
were forbidden by law and custom to cultivate it themselves, both on
the ground that such labour was degrading, and in order that they
might always be free for military service. The serfs were not bought
and sold, but remained attached to the land, which was divided into
lots, one or more for each adult male Spartan. These lots, like the
helots, could not be bought or sold, and passed, by law, from father
to son. (They could, however, be bequeathed.) The landowner received
from the helot who cultivated the lot seventy medirnni (about 105
bushels) of grain for himself, twelve for his wife, and a stated
portion of wine and fruit annually.[^49] Anything beyond this amount
was the property of the helot. The helots were Greeks, like the
Spartans, and bitterly resented their servile condition. When they
could, they rebelled. The Spartans had a body of secret police to deal
with this danger, but to supplement this precaution they had another:
once a year, they declared war on the helots, so that their young men
could kill any who seemed insubordinate without incurring the legal
guilt of homicide. Helots could be emancipated by the State, but not
by their masters; they were emancipated, rather rarely, for
exceptional bravery in battle.

[^49]: Bury, _History of Greece_, Vol. I, p. 138. It seems that Spartan men ate nearly six times as much as their wives. 


At some time during the eighth century BC the Spartans conquered the neighboring country of Messenia, and reduced most 
of its inhabitants to the condition of helots. There had been a 
lack of _Lebensraum_ in Sparta, but the new territory, for a time, 
removed this source of discontent. 

Lots were for the common run of Spartans; the aristocracy had 
estates of their own, whereas the lots were portions of common 
land assigned by the State. 

The free inhabitants of other parts of Laconia, called "perioeci," 
had no share of political power. 

The sole business of a Spartan citizen was war, to which he was 
trained from birth. Sickly children were exposed after inspection 
by the heads of the tribe; only those judged vigorous were allowed 
to be reared. Up to the age of twenty, all the boys were trained in 
one big school; the purpose of the training was to make them 
hardy, indifferent to pain, and submissive to discipline. There 
was no nonsense about cultural or scientific education; the sole 
aim was to produce good soldiers, wholly devoted to the State. 

At the age of twenty, actual military service began. Marriage 
was permitted to anyone over the age of twenty, but until the 
age of thirty a man had to live in the "men's house," and had to 
manage his marriage as if it were an illicit and secret affair. After 
thirty, he was a full-fledged citizen. Every citizen belonged to a 
mess, and dined with the other members; he had to make a 
contribution in kind from the produce of his lot. It was the theory 
of the State that no Spartan citizen should be destitute, and none 
should be rich. Each was expected to live on the produce of his 
lot, which lie could not alienate except by free gift. None was 
allowed to own gold or silver, and the money was made of iron. 
Spartan simplicity became proverbial. 

The position of women in Sparta was peculiar. They were not 
secluded, like respectable women elsewhere in Greece. Girls went 
through the same physical training as was given to boys; what is 
more remarkable, boys and girls did their gymnastics together, 
all being naked. It was desired (I quote Plutarch's _Lycurgus_ in 
North's translation): 

> that the maidens should harden their bodies with exercise of
> running, wrestling, throwing the bar, and casting the dart, to the
> end that the fruit wherewith they might be afterwards conceived,
> taking nourishment of a strong and lusty body, should shoot out and
> spread the better: and that they by gathering strength thus by
> exercises, should more easily away with the pains of child
> bearing.... And though the maidens did show themselves thus naked
> openly, yet was there no dishonesty seen nor offered, but all this
> sport was full of play and toys, without any youthful part or
> wantonness.

Men who would not marry were made "infamous by law," and 
compelled, even in the coldest weather, to walk up and down 
naked outside the place where the young people were doing their 
exercises and dances. 

Women were not allowed to exhibit any emotion not profitable 
to the State. They might display contempt for a coward, and 
would be praised if he were their son; but they might not show 
grief if their new-born child was condemned to death as a weakling, 
or if their sons were killed in battle. They were considered, by 
other Greeks, exceptionally chaste; at the same time, a childless 
married woman would raise no objection if the State ordered her 
to find out whether some other man would be more successful 
than her husband in begetting citizens. Children were encouraged 
by legislation. According to Aristotle, the father of three sons was 
exempt from military service, and the father of four from all the 
burdens of the State. 

The constitution of Sparta was complicated. There were two 
kings, belonging to two different families, and succeeding by 
heredity. One or other of the kings commanded the army in time 
of war, but in time of peace their powers were limited. At communal feasts they got twice as much to eat as any one else, and 
there was general mourning when one of them died. They were 
members of the Council of Elders, a body consisting of thirty 
men (including the kings); the other twenty-eight must be over 
sixty, and were chosen for life by the whole body of the citizens, 
but only from aristocratic families. The Council tried criminal 
cases, and prepared matters which were to come before the 
Assembly. This body (the Assembly) consisted of all the citizens; 
it could not initiate anything, but could vote yes or no to any 
proposal brought before it. No law could be enacted without 
its consent. But its consent, though necessary, was not sufficient; 
the elders and magistrates must proclaim the decision before it 
became valid. 

In addition to the kings, the Council of Elders, and the 
Assembly, there was a fourth branch of the government, peculiar 
to Sparta. This was the five ephors. These were chosen out of the 
whole body of the citizens, by a method which Aristotle says was 
"too childish," and which Bury says was virtually by lot. They 
were a "democratic" element in the constitution,[^50] apparently 
intended to balance the kings. Every month the kings swore to 
uphold the constitution, and the ephors then swore to uphold the 
kings so long as they remained true to their oath. When either 
king went on a warlike expedition, two ephors accompanied him 
to watch over his behavior. The ephors were the supreme civil 
court, but over the kings they had criminal jurisdiction. 

[^50]: In speaking of "democratic" elements in the Spartan constitution, one must of course remember that the citizens as a whole were a ruling class fiercely tyrannizing over the helots, and allowing no power to die perioeci. 

The Spartan constitution was supposed, in later antiquity, to 
have been due to a legislator named Lycurgus, who was said to 
have promulgated his laws in 885 BC. In fact, the Spartan system 
grew up gradually, and Lycurgus was a mythical person, originally 
a god. His name meant "wolf-repeller," and his origin was 
Arcadian. 

Sparta aroused among the other Greeks an admiration which 
is to us somewhat surprising. Originally, it had been much less 
different from other Greek cities than it became later; in early 
days it produced ports and artists as good as those elsewhere. 
But about the seventh century BC, or perhaps even later, its constitution (falsely attributed to Lycurgus) crystallized into the form 
we have been considering; everything else was sacrificed to success 
in war, and Sparta ceased to have any part whatever in what 
Greece contributed to the civilization of the world. To us, the 
Spartan State appears as a model, in miniature, of the State that 
the Nazis would establish if victorious. To the Greeks it seemed 
otherwise. As Bury says: 

> A stranger from Athens or Miletus in the fifth century visiting 
> the straggling villages which formed her unwalled unpretentious 
> city must have bad a feeling of being transported into an age 
> long past, when men were braver, better and simpler, unspoiled 
> by wealth, undisturbed by ideas. To a philosopher, like Plato, 
> speculating in political science, the Spartan State seemed the 
> nearest approach to the ideal. The ordinary Greek looked upon 
> it as a structure of severe and simple beauty, a Dorian city stately 
> as a Dorian temple, far nobler than his own abode but not so 
> comfortable to dwell in.[^51]

[^51]: _History of Greece_, Vol. I, p. 141. 

One reason for the admiration felt for Sparta by other Greeks 
was its stability. All other Greek cities had revolutions, but the 
Spartan constitution remained unchanged for centuries, except 
for a gradual increase in the powers of the ephors, which occurred 
by legal means, without violence. 

It cannot be denied that, for a long period, the Spartans were
successful in their main purpose, the creation of a race of invincible
warriors. The battle of Thermopylae (480 BC), though technically a
defeat, is perhaps the best example of their valour. Thermopylae was a
narrow pass through the mountains, where it was hoped that the Persian
army could be held. Three hundred Spartans, with auxiliaries, repulsed
all frontal attacks. Hut at last the Persians discovered a detour
through the hills, and succeeded in attacking the Greeks on both sides
at once. Every single Spartan was killed at his post. Two men had been
absent on sick leave, suffering from a disease of the eyes amounting
almost to temporary blindness. One of them insisted on being led by
his helot to the battle, where he perished; the other, Aristodemus,
decided that he was too ill to fight, and remained absent. When he
returned to Sparta, no one would speak to him; he was called "the
coward Aristodemus." A year later, he wiped out his disgrace by dying
bravely at the battle of Plataea, where the Spartans were victorious.

After the war, the Spartans erected a memorial on the battlefield 
of Thermopylae, saying only: "Stranger, tell the Lacedaemonians 
that we lie here, in obedience to their orders."

For a long time, the Spartans proved themselves invincible on 
land. They retained their supremacy until the year 371 BC, when 
they were defeated by the Thebans at the battle of Leuctra. This 
was the end of their military greatness. 

Apart from war, the reality of Sparta was never quite the same 
as the theory. Herodotus, who lived at its great period, remarks, 
surprisingly, that no Spartan could resist a bribe. This was in spite 
of the fact that contempt for riches and love of the simple life was 
one of the main things inculcated in Spartan education. We are 
told that the Spartan women were chaste, yet it happened several 
times that a reputed heir to the kingship was set aside on the 
ground of not being the son of his mother's husband. We are told 
that the Spartans were inflexibly patriotic, yet the king Pausanias, 
the victor of Plataea, ended as a traitor in the pay of Xerxes. 
Apart from such flagrant matters, the policy of Sparta was always 
petty and provincial. When Athens liberated the Greeks of Asia 
Minor and the adjacent islands from the Persians, Sparta held 
aloof; so long as the Peloponnesus was deemed safe, the fate of 
other Greeks was a matter of indifference. Every attempt at a 
confederation of the Hellenic world was defeated by Spartan 
particularism. 

Aristotle, who lived after the downfall of Sparta, gives a very
hostile account of its constitution.[^52] What he says is so different
from what other people say that it is difficult to believe he is
speaking of the same place, e.g. "The legislator wanted to make the
whole State hardy and temperate, and he has carried out his intention
in the case of men, but he has neglected the women, who live in every
sort of intemperance and luxury. The consequence is that in such a
State wealth is too highly valued, especially if the citizens fall
under the dominion of their wives, after the manner of most warlike
races.... Even in regard to courage, which is of no use in daily life,
and is needed only in war, the influence of the Lacecdaemonian women
has been most mischievous.... This license of the Lacedaemonian women
existed from the earliest times, and was only what might be expected.
For... when Lycurgus, as tradition says, wanted to bring the women
under his laws, they resisted, and he gave up the attempt."

[^52]: _Politics_, Vol. II, 9 ( 1269H--1270A). 

He goes on to accuse Spartans of avarice, which he attributes 
to the unequal distribution of property. Although lots cannot be 
sold, he says, they can be given or bequeathed. Two-fifths of all 
the land, he adds, belongs to women. The consequence is a great 
diminution in the number of citizens: it is said that once there 
were ten thousand, but at the time of the defeat by Thebes there 
were less than one thousand. 

Aristotle criticizes every point of the Spartan constitution. He says
that the ephors are often very poor, and therefore easy to bribe; and
their power is so great that even kings are compelled to court them,
so that the constitution has been turned into a democracy. The ephors,
we are told, have too much license, and live in a manner contrary to
the spirit of the constitution, while the strictness in relation to
ordinary citizens is so intolerable that they take refuge in the
secret illegal indulgence of sensual pleasures.

Aristotle wrote when Sparta was decadent, but on some points he
expressly says that the evil he is mentioning has existed from early
times. His tone is so dry and realistic that it is difficult to
disbelieve him, and it is in line with all modern experience of the
results of excessive severity in the laws. But it was not Aristotle's
Sparta that persisted in men's imagination; it was the mythical Sparta
of Plutarch and the philosophic idealization of Sparta in Plato's
_Republic_. Century after century, young men read these works, and were
fired with the ambition to become Lycurguses or philosopher-kings. The
resulting union of idealism and love of power has led men astray over
and over again, and is still doing so in the present day.

The myth of Sparta, for medieval and modern readers, was 
mainly fixed by Plutarch. When he wrote, Sparta belonged to the 
romantic past; its great period was as far removed from his time 
as Columbus is from ours. What he says must be treated with 
great caution by the historian of institutions, but to the historian 
of myth it is of the utmost importance. Greece has influenced the 
world, always, through its effect on men's imaginations, ideals, 
and hopes, not directly through political power. Rome made roads 
which largely still survive, and laws which are the source of many 
modern legal codes, but it was the armies of Rome that made these 
things important. The Greeks, though admirable fighters, made 
few conquests, because they expended their military fury mainly 
on each other. It was left to the semi-barbarian Alexander to spread 
Hellenism throughout the Near East, and to make Greek the 
literary language in Egypt and Syria and the inland parts of Asia 
Minor. The Greeks could never have accomplished this task, not 
for lack of military force, but owing to their incapacity for 
political cohesion. The political vehicles of Hellenism have always 
been non-Hellenic; but it was the Greek genius that so inspired 
alien nations as to cause them to spread the culture of those 
whom they had conquered. 

What is important to the historian of the world is not the petty wars
between Greek cities, or the sordid squabbles for party ascendancy,
but the memories retained by mankind when the brief episode was ended
like the recollection of a brilliant sunrise in the Alps, while the
mountaineer struggles through an arduous day of wind and snow. These
memories, as they gradually faded, left in men's minds the images of
certain peaks that had shone with peculiar brightness in the early
light, keeping alive the knowledge that behind the clouds a splendor
still survived, and might at any moment become manifest. Of these,
Plato was the most important in early Christianity, Aristotle in the
medieval Church; hut when, after the Renaissance, men began to value
political freedom, it was above all to Plutarch that they turned. He
influenced profoundly the English and French liberals of the
eighteenth century, and the founders of the United States; he
influenced the romantic movement in Germany, and has continued, mainly
by indirect channels, to influence German thought down to the present
day. In some ways his influence was good, in some bad; as regards
Lycurgus and Sparta, it was bad. What he has to say about Lycurgus is
important, and I shall give a brief account of it, even at the cost of
some repetition.

Lycurgus so Plutarch says having resolved to give laws to Sparta,
travelled widely in order to study different institutions. He liked
the laws of Crete, which were "very straight and severe,"[^53] but
disliked those of Ionia, where there were "superfluities and
vanities." In Egypt he learned the advantage of separating the
soldiers from the rest of the people, and afterwards, having returned
from his travels, "brought the practice of it into Sparta: where
setting the merchants, artificers, and labourers every one a part by
themselves, he did establish a noble Commonwealth." He made an equal
division of lands among all the citizens of Sparta in order to "banish
out of the city all insolvency, envy, covetousness, and deliciousness,
and also all riches and poverty." He forbade gold and silver money,
allowing only iron coinage, of so little value that "to lay up thereof
the value often minas, it would have occupied a whole cellar in a
house." By this means he banished "all superfluous and unprofitable
sciences," since there was not enough money to pay their
practitioners; and by the same law he made all external commerce
impossible. Rhetoricians, panders, and jewelers, not liking the iron
money, avoided Sparta. He next ordained that all the citizens should
eat together, and all should have the same food.

[^53]: In quoting Plutarch I use North's translation. 

Lycurgus, like other reformers, thought the education of children "the
chiefest and greatest matter, that a reformer of laws should
establish"; and like all who aim chiefly nt military power, he was
anxious to keep up the birth rate. The "plays, sports, and dances the
maids did naked before young men, were provocations to draw and allure
the young men to marry: not as persuaded by geometrical reasons, as
saith Plato, but brought to it by liking, and of very love." The habit
of treating a marriage, for the first few years, as if it were a
clandestine affair, "continued in both parties a still burning love,
and a new desire of the one to the other" such, at least, is the
opinion of Plutarch. He goes on to explain that a man was not thought
ill of if, being old and having a young wife, he allowed a younger man
to have children by her. "It was lawful also for an honest man that
loved another man's wife ... to intreat her husband to suffer him to
lie with her, and that he might also plough in that lusty ground, an
cast abroad the seed of well-favored children." There was to be no
foolish jealousy, for "Lycurgus did not like that children should be
private to any men, but that they should be common to the common weal:
by which reason he would also, that such as should become citizens
should not be begotten of every man, but of the most honest men only."
He goes on to explain that this is the principle that farmers apply to
their live-stock.

When a child was born, the father brought him before the elders of his
family to be examined: if he was healthy, he was given back to the
father to he reared; if not, he was thrown into a deep pit of water.
Children, from the first, were subjected to a severe hardening
process, in some respects good for example, they were not put in
swaddling clothes. At the age of seven, boys were taken away from home
and put in a boarding school, where they were divided into companies,
each under the orders of one of their number, chosen for sense and
courage. "Touching learning, they had as much as served their turn:
for the rest of their time they spent in learning how to obey, to away
with pain, to endure labour, to overcome still in fight." They played
naked together most of the time; after twelve years old, they wore no
coats; they were always "nasty and sluttish," and they never bathed
except on certain days in the year. They slept on beds of straw, which
in winter they mixed with thistle. They were taught to steal, and were
punished if caught not for stealing, but for stupidity.

Homosexual love, male if not female, was a recognized 
custom in Sparta, and had an acknowledged part in the education 
of adolescent boys. A boy's lover suffered credit or discredit by 
the boy's actions; Plutarch states that once, when a boy cried out 
because he was hurt in fighting, his lover was fined for the boy's 
cowardice. 

There was little liberty at any stage in the life of a Spartan. 

Their discipline and order of life continued still, after they 
were full grown men, For it was not lawful for any man to live 
as he listed, but they were within their city, as if they had been in 
a camp, where every man knoweth what allowance he hath to live 
withal, and what business he hath else to do in his calling. To be 
short, they were all of this mind, that they were not born to serve 
themselves, but to serve their country.... One of the best and 
happiest things which Lycurgus ever brought into his city, was 
the great rest and leisure which he made his citizens to have, only 
forbidding them that they should not profess any vile or base 
occupation: and they needed not also to be careful to get great 
riches, in a place where goods were nothing profitable nor esteemed. 
For the helots, which were bond men made by the wars, did till 
their grounds, and yielded them a certain revenue every year. 

Plutarch goes on to tell a story of an Athenian condemned for 
idleness, upon hearing of which a Spartan exclaimed: "show me 
the man condemned for living nobly and like a gentleman." 

Lycurgus (Plutarch continues) "did accustom his citizens so, 
that they neither would nor could live alone, but were in manner 
as men incorporated one with another, and were always in company 
together, as the bees be about their master bee." 

Spartans were not allowed to travel, nor were foreigners admitted 
to Sparta, except on business; for it was feared that alien customs 
would corrupt Lacedaemonian virtue. 

Plutarch relates the law that allowed Spartans to kill helots whenever
they felt so disposed, but refuses to believe that anything so
abominable can have been due to Lycurgus. "For I cannot be persuaded,
that ever Lycurgus invented, or instituted so wicked and mischievous
an act, as that kind of ordinance was: because I imagine his nature
was gentle and merciful, by the clemency and justice we see he used in
all his other doings." Except in this matter Plutarch has nothing but
praise for the constitution of Sparta.

The effect of Sparta on Plato, with whom, at the moment, we 
shall be specially concerned, will be evident from the account of 
his Utopia, which will occupy the next chapter. 

## Chapter XIII THE SOURCES OF PLATO'S OPINIONS 

Plato and Aristotle were the most influential of all philosophers,
ancient, medieval, or modern; and of the two, it was Plato who had the
greater effect upon subsequent ages. I say this for two reasons:
first, that Aristotle himself is an outcome of Plato; second, that
Christian theology and philosophy, at any rate until the thirteenth
century, was much more Platonic than Aristotelian. It is necessary
therefore, in a history of philosophic thought, to treat Plato, and to
a lesser degree Aristotle, more fully than any of their predecessors
or successors.

The most important matters in Plato's philosophy are: first, his
Utopia, which was the earliest of a long series; second, his theory of
ideas, which was a pioneer attempt to deal with the still unsolved
problem of universals; third, his arguments in favor of immortality;
fourth, his cosmogony; fifth, his conception of knowledge as
reminiscence rather than perception. But before dealing with any of
these topics, I shall say a few words about the circumstances of his
life and the influences which determined his political and
philosophical opinions.

Plato was born in 428--7 BC, in the early years of the Peloponnesian
War. He was a well-to-do aristocrat, related to various people who
were concerned in the rule of the Thirty Tyrants. He was a young man
when Athens was defeated, and he could attribute the defeat to
democracy, which his social position and his family connections were
likely to make him despise. He was a pupil of Socrates, for whom he
had a profound affection and respect; and Socrates was put to death by
the democracy. It is not, therefore, surprising that he should turn to
Sparta for an adumbration of his ideal commonwealth. Plato possessed
the art to dress up illiberal suggestions in such a way that they
deceived future ages, which admired the _Republic_ without ever
becoming aware of what was involved in its proposals. It has always
been correct to praise Plato, but not to understand him. This is the
common fate of great men. My object is the opposite. I wish to
understand him but to treat him with as little reverence as if he were
a contemporary English or American advocate of totalitarianism.

The purely philosophical influences on Plato were also such as 
to predispose him in favor of Sparta. These influences, speaking 
broadly, were: Pythagoras, Parmenides, Heraclitus, and Socrates. 

From Pythagoras (whether by way of Socrates or not) Plato 
derived the Orphic elements in his philosophy: the religious trend, 
the belief in immortality, the other-worldliness, the priestly tone, 
and all that is involved in the simile of the cave; also his respect 
for mathematics, and his intimate intermingling of intellect and 
mysticism. 

From Parmenides he derived the belief that reality is eternal 
and timeless, and that, on logical grounds, all change must be 
illusory. 

From Heraclitus he derived the negative doctrine that there is 
nothing permanent in the sensible world. This, combined with the 
doctrine of Parmenides, led to the conclusion that knowledge is 
not to be derived from the senses, but is only to be achieved by 
the intellect. This, in turn, fitted in well with Pythagoreanism. 

From Socrates he probably learnt his preoccupation with 
ethical problems, and his tendency to seek teleological rather than 
mechanical explanations of the world. "The Good" dominated his 
thought more than that of the pre-Socratics, and it is difficult not 
to attribute this fact to the influence of Socrates. 

How is all this connected with authoritarianism in politics? 

In the first place: Goodness and Reality being timeless, the best
State will be the one which most nearly copies the heavenly model, by
having a minimum of change and a maximum of static perfection, and its
rulers should be those who best understand the eternal Good.

In the second place: Plato, like all mystics, has, in his beliefs, a
core of certainty which is essentially incommunicable except by a way
of life. The Pythagoreans had endeavored to set up a rule of the
initiate, and this is, at bottom, what Plato desires. If a man is to
be a good statesman, he must know the Good; this he can only do by a
combination of intellectual and moral discipline. If those who have
not gone through this discipline are allowed a share in the
government, they will inevitably corrupt it.

In the third place: much education is needed to make a good ruler on
Plato's principles. It seems to us unwise to have insisted on teaching
geometry to the younger Dionysus, tyrant of Syracuse, in order to make
him a good king, but from Plato's point of view it was essential. He
was sufficiently Pythagorean to think that without mathematics no true
wisdom is possible. This view implies an oligarchy.

In the fourth place: Plato, in common with most Greek philosophers,
took the view that leisure is essential to wisdom, which will
therefore not be found among those who have to work for their living,
but only among those who have independent means or who are relieved by
the State from anxieties as to their subsistence. This point of view
is essentially aristocratic.

Two general questions arise in confronting Plato with modern 
ideas. The first is: is there such a thing as "wisdom"? The second 
is: granted that there is such a thing, can any constitution be 
devised that will give it political power? 

"Wisdom," in the sense supposed, would not be any kind of specialized
skill, such as is possessed by the shoemaker or the physician or the
military tactician. It must be something more generalized than this,
since its possession is supposed to make a man capable of governing
wisely. I think Plato would have said that it consists in knowledge of
the good, and would have supplemented this definition with the
Socratic doctrine that no man sins wittingly, from which it follows
that whoever knows what is good does what is right. To us, such a view
seems remote from reality. We should more naturally say that there are
divergent interests, and that the statesman should arrive at the best
available compromise. The members of a class or a nation may have a
common interest, but it will usually conflict with the interests of
other classes or other nations. There are, no doubt, some interests of
mankind as a whole, but they do not suffice to determine political
action. Perhaps they will do so at some future date, but certainly not
so long as there are many sovereign States. And even then the most
difficult part of the pursuit of the general interest would consist in
arriving at compromises among mutually hostile special interests.

But even if we suppose that there is such a thing as "wisdom," is
there any form of constitution which will give the government to the
wise? It is clear that majorities, like general councils, may err, and
in fact have erred. Aristocracies are not always wise; kings are often
foolish; Popes, in spite of infallibility, have committed grievous
errors. Would anybody advocate entrusting the government to university
graduates, or even to doctors of divinity? Or to men who, having been
born poor, have made great fortunes? It is clear that no legally
definable selection of citizens is likely to be wiser, in practice,
than the whole body.

It might be suggested that men could be given political wisdom 
by a suitable training. But the question would arise: what is a 
suitable training? And this would turn out to be a party question. 

The problem of finding a collection of "wise" men and leaving 
the government to them is thus an insoluble one. That is the 
ultimate reason for democracy. 

## Chapter XIV PLATO'S UTOPIA 

Plato's most important dialogue, the _Republic_, consists, 
broadly, of three parts. The first (to near the end of Book V) 
consists in the construction of an ideal commonwealth; it is 
the earliest of Utopias. 

One of the conclusions arrived at is that the rulers must be
philosophers. Books VI and VII are concerned to define the word
"philosopher." This discussion constitutes the second section.

The third section consists mainly of a discussion of various 
kinds of actual constitutions and of their merits and defects. 

The nominal purpose of the _Republic_ is to define "justice." But at an
early stage it is decided that, since everything is easier to see in
the large than in the small, it will be better to inquire what makes a
just State than what makes a just individual. And since justice must
be among the attributes of the best imaginable State, such a State is
first delineated, and then it is decided which of its perfections is
to be called "justice."

Let us first describe Plato's Utopia in its broad outlines, and 
then consider points that arise by the way. 

Plato begins by deciding that the citizens are to be divided into
three classes: the common people, the soldiers, and the guardians. The
last, alone, are to have political power. There are to be much fewer
of them than of the other two classes. In the first instance, it
seems, they are to be chosen by the legislator; after that, they will
usually succeed by heredity, but in exceptional cases a promising
child may be promoted from one of the inferior classes, while among
the children of guardians a child or young man who is unsatisfactory
may be degraded.

The main problem, as Plato perceives, is to insure that the guardians
shall carry out the intentions of the legislator. For this purpose he
has various proposals, educational, economic, biological, and
religious. It is not always clear how far these proposals apply to
other classes than the guardians; it is clear that some of them apply
to the soldiers, but in the main Plato is concerned only with the
guardians? who are to be a class apart, like the Jesuits in old
Paraguay, the ecclesiastics in the States of the Church until 1870,
and the Communist Party in the U.S.S.R. at the present day.

The first thing to consider is education. This is divided into 
two parts, music and gymnastics. Each has a wider meaning than 
at present: "music" means everything that is in the province of 
the muses, and "gymnastics" means everything concerned with 
physical training and fitness. "Music" is almost as wide as what 
we should call "culture" and "gymnastics" is somewhat wider 
than what we call "athletics." 

Culture is to be devoted to making men _gentlemen_, in the sense
which, largely owing to Plato, is familiar in England. The Athens of
his day was, in one respect, analogous to England in the nineteenth
century: there was in each an aristocracy enjoying wealth and social
prestige, but having no monopoly of political power; and in each the
aristocracy had to secure as much power as it could by means of
impressive behavior. In Plato's Utopia, however, the aristocracy
rules unchecked.

Gravity, decorum and courage seem to be the qualities mainly to be
cultivated in education. There is to be a rigid censorship from very
early years over the literature to which the young have access and the
music they are allowed to hear. Mothers and nurses are to tell their
children only authorized stories. Homer and Hesiod are not to be
allowed, for a number of reasons. First they represent the gods as
behaving badly on occasion, which is unedifying; the young must be
taught that evils never come from the gods, for God is not the author
of all things, but only of good things. Second, there are things in
Homer and Hesiod which are calculated to make their readers fear
death, whereas everything ought to he done in education to make young
people willing to die in battle. Our boys must be taught to consider
slavery worse than death, and therefore they must have no stories of
good men weeping and wailing, even for the death of friends. Third,
decorum demands that there should never be loud laughter, and yet
Homer speaks of "inextinguishable laughter among the blessed gods."
How is a schoolmaster to reprove mirth effectively, if boys can quote
this passage? Fourth, there are passages in Homer praising rich
feasts, and others describing the lusts of the gods; such passages
discourage temperance. (Dean Inge, a true Platonist, objected to a
line in a well-known hymn: "The shout of them that triumph, the song
of them that feast," which occurs in a description of the joys of
heaven.) Then there must be no stories in which the wicked are happy
or the good unhappy; the moral effect on tender minds might be most
unfortunate. On all these counts, the poets are to be condemned.

Plato passes on to a curious argument about the drama. The good man,
he says, ought to be unwilling to imitate a bad man; now most plays
contain villains; therefore the dramatist, and the actor who plays the
villain's part, have to imitate people guilty of various crimes. Not
only criminals, but women, slaves, and inferiors generally, ought not
to be imitated by superior men. (In Greece, as in Elizabethan England,
women's parts were acted by men.) Plays, therefore, if permissible at
all, must contain no characters except faultless male heroes of good
birth. The impossibility of this is so evident that Plato decides to
banish all dramatists from his city:

> When any of these pantomimic gentlemen, who are so clever 
> that they can imitate anything, comes to us, and makes a proposal 
> to exhibit himself and his poetry, we will fall down and worship 
> him as a sweet and holy and wonderful being; but we must 
> also inform him that in our State such as he are not permitted to 
> exist; the law will not allow them. And so when we have anointed 
> him with myrrh, and set a garland of wool upon his head, we shall 
> send him away to another city. 

Next we come to the censorship of music (in the modern sense). 
The Lydian and Ionian harmonies are to be forbidden, the first 
because it expresses sorrow, the second because it is relaxed. Only 
the Dorian (for courage) and the Phrygian (for temperance) are 
to be allowed. Permissible rhythms must be simple, and such as 
are expressive of a courageous and harmonious life. 

The training of the body is to be very austere. No one is to eat 
fish, or meat cooked otherwise than roasted, and there must be 
no sauces or confectionery. People brought up on his regimen, 
he says, will have no need of doctors. 

Up to a certain age, the young are to see no ugliness or vice. But at
a suitable moment, they must be exposed to "enchantments" both in the
shape of terrors that must not terrify, and of bad pleasures that must
not seduce the will. Only after they have withstood these tests will
they be judged fit to be guardians.

Young boys, before they are grown up, should see war, though 
they should not themselves fight. 

As for economics: Plato proposes a thoroughgoing communism for the
guardians, and (I think) also for the soldiers, though this is not
very clear. The guardians are to have small houses and simple food;
they are to live as in a camp, dining together in companies; they are
to have no private property beyond what is absolutely necessary. Gold
and silver are to be forbidden. Though not rich, there is no reason
why they should not be happy; but the purpose of the city is the good
of the whole, not the happiness of one class. Both wealth and poverty
are harmful, and in Plato's city neither will exist. There is a
curious argument about war, that it will be easy to purchase allies,
since our city will not want any share in the spoils of victory.

With feigned unwillingness, the Platonic Socrates proceeds to apply
his communism to the family. Friends, he says, should have all things
in common, including women and children. He admits that this presents
difficulties, but thinks them not insuperable. First of all, girls are
to have exactly the same education as boys, learning music,
gymnastics, and the art of war along with the boys. Women are to have
complete equality with men in all respects. "The same education which
makes a man a good guardian will make a woman a good guardian; for
their original nature is the same." No doubt there are differences
between men and women, but they have nothing to do with politics. Some
women are philosophic, and suitable as guardians; some are warlike,
and could make good soldiers.

The legislator, having selected the guardians, some men and some
women, will ordain that they shall all share common houses and common
meals. Marriage, as we know it, will be radically transformed.[^54] At
certain festivals, brides and bridegrooms, in such numbers as are
required to keep the population constant, mil be brought together, by
lot, as they will be taught to believe; but in fact the rulers of the
city will manipulate the lots on eugenic principles. They will arrange
that the best sires shall have the most children. All children will be
taken away from their parents at birth, and great care will be taken
that no parents shall know who are their children, and no children
shall know who are their parents. Deformed children, and children of
inferior parents, "will be put away in some mysterious unknown place,
as they ought to be." Children arising from unions not sanctioned by
the State are to be considered illegitimate. Mothers are to be between
twenty and forty, fathers between twenty-five and fifty-five. Outside
these ages, intercourse is to be free, but abortion or infanticide is
to be compulsory. In the "marriages" arranged by the State, the people
concerned have no voice; they are to be actuated by the thought of
their duty to the State, not by any of those common emotions that the
banished poets used to celebrate.

[^54]: "These women shall be, without exception, the common wives of these men, and no one shall have a wife of his own." 

Since no one knows who his parents are, he is to call every one 
"father" whose age is such that he might be his father, and 
similarly as regards "mother" and "brother" and "sister." (This 
sort of thing happens among some savages, and used to puzzle 
missionaries.) There is to be no marriage between a "father" and 
"daughter" or "mother" and "son"; in general, but not absolutely, 
marriages of "brother" and "sister" are to be prevented. (I think 
if Plato had thought this out more carefully he would have found 
that he had prohibited all marriages, except the "brother-sister" 
marriages which he regards as rare exceptions.) 

It is supposed that the sentiments at present attached to the words
"father," "mother," "son," and "daughter" will still attach to them
under Plato's new arrangements; a young man, for instance, will not
strike an old man, because he might be striking his father.

The advantage sought is, of course, to minimize private possessive
emotions, and so remove obstacles to the domination of public spirit,
as well as to acquiescence in the absence of private property. It was
largely motives of a similar kind that led to the celibacy of the
clergy.[^55]

[^55]: See Henry C. Lea, _A History of Sacerdotal Celibacy_. 

I come last to the theological aspect of the system. I am not thinking
of the accepted Greek gods, but of certain myths which the government
is to inculcate. Lying, Plato says explicitly, is to be a prerogative
of the government, just as giving medicine is of physicians. The
government, as we have already seen, is to deceive people in
pretending to arrange marriages by lot, but this is not a religious
matter.

There is to be "one royal lie," which, Plato hopes, may deceive 
the rulers, but will at any rate deceive the rest of the city. This 
"lie" is set forth in considerable detail. The most important part 
of it is the dogma that God has created men of three kinds, the 
best made of gold, the second best of silver, and the common 
herd of brass and iron. Those made of gold are fit to be guardians; 
those made of silver should be soldiers; the others should do the 
manual work. Usually, but by no means always, children will 
belong to the same grade as their parents; when they do not, they 
must be promoted or degraded accordingly. It is thought hardly 
possible to make the present generation believe this myth, but the 
next, and all subsequent generations, can be so educated as not 
to doubt it. 

Plato is right in thinking that belief in this myth could be 
generated in two generations. The Japanese have been taught 
since 1868 that the Mikado is descended from the sun-goddess, 
and that Japan was created earlier than the rest of the world. Any 
university professor, who, even in a learned work, throws doubt 
on these dogmas, is dismissed for un-Japanese activities. What 
Plato does not seem to realize is that the compulsory acceptance 
of such myths is incompatible with philosophy, and involves a 
kind of education which stunts intelligence. 

The definition of "justice" which is the nominal goal of the 
whole discussion, is reached in Book IV. It consists, we are told, 
in everybody doing his own work and not being a busybody: the 
city is _just_ when trader, auxiliary, and guardian, each does his 
own job without interfering with that of other classes. 

That everybody should mind his own business is no doubt an 
admirable precept, but it hardly corresponds to what a modern 
would naturally call "justice." The Greek word so translated 
corresponded to a concept which was very important in Greek 
thought, but for which we have no exact equivalent. It is worth 
while to recall what Anaximander said: 

> Into that from which things take their rise they pass away once 
> more, as is ordained; for they make reparation and satisfaction to 
> one another for their injustice according to the appointed time. 

Before philosophy began, the Greeks had a theory or feeling about the
universe, which may be called religious or ethical. According to this
theory, every person and every thing has his or its appointed place
and appointed function. This does not depend upon the fiat of Zeus,
for Zeus himself is subject to the same kind of law as governs others.
The theory is connected with the idea of fate or necessity. It applies
emphatitally to the heavenly bodies. But where there is vigor, there
is a tendency to overstep just bounds; hence arises strife. Some kind
of impersonal super-Olympian law punishes hubris, and restores the
eternal order which the aggressor sought to violate. This whole
outlook, originally, perhaps, scarcely conscious, passed over into
philosophy; it is to be found alike in cosmologies of strife, such as
those of Heraclitus and Empedocles, and in monistic doctrines such as
that of Parmenides. It is the source of the belief both in natural and
in human law, and it clearly underlies Plato's conception of justice.

The word "justice," as still used in the law, is more similar to
Plato's conception than it is as used in political speculation. Under
the influence of democratic theory, we have come to associate justice
with equality: while for Plato it has no such implication. "Justice,"
in the sense in which it is almost synonymous with "law" as when we
speak of "courts of justice" is concerned mainly with property rights,
which have nothing to do with equality. The first suggested definition
of "justice," at the beginning of the _Republic_, is that it consists in
paying debts. This definition is soon abandoned as inadequate, but
something of it remains at the end.

There are several points to be noted about Plato's definition. 
First, it makes it possible to have inequalities of power and 
privilege without injustice. The guardians are to have all the power, 
because they are the wisest members of the community; injustice 
would only occur, on Plato's definition, if there were men in the 
other classes who were wiser than some of the guardians. That is 
why Plato provides for promotion and degradation of citizens, 
although he thinks that the double advantage of birth and education will, in most cases, make the children of guardians superior 
to the children of others. If there were a more exact science of 
government, and more certainty of men following its precepts, 
there would be much to be said for Plato's system. No one thinks 
it unjust to put the best men into a football team, although they 
acquire thereby a great superiority. If football were managed as 
democratically as the Athenian government the students to play 
for their university would be chosen by lot. But in matters of 
government it is difficult to know who has the most skill, and 
very far from certain that a politician will use his skill in the 
public interest rather than in his own or in that of his class or 
party or creed. 

The next point is that Plato's definition of "justice" presupposes a
State organized either on traditional lines, or, like his own, so as
to realize, in its totality, some ethical ideal. Justice, we are told,
consists in every man doing his own job. But what is a man's job? In a
State which, like ancient Egypt or the kingdom of the Incas, remains
unchanged generation after generation, a man's job is his father's
job, and no question arises. But in Plato's State no man has any legal
father. His job, therefore, must be decided either by his own tastes
or by the State's judgment as to his aptitudes. The latter is
obviously what Plato would desire. But some kinds of work, though
highly skilled, may be deemed pernicious; Plato takes this view of
poetry, and I should take it of the work of Napoleon. The purposes of
the Government, therefore, are essential in determining what is a
man's job. Although all the rulers are to be philosophers, there are
to be no innovations: a philosopher is to be, for all time, a man who
understands and agrees with Plato.

When we ask: what will Plato's _Republic_ achieve? the answer is rather
humdrum. It will achieve success in wars against roughly equal
populations, and it will secure a livelihood for a certain small
number of people. It will almost certainly produce no art or science,
because of its rigidity; in this respect, as in others, it will be
like Sparta. In spite of all the fine talk, skill in war and enough to
eat is all that will be achieved. Plato had lived through famine and
defeat in Athens; perhaps, subconsciously, he thought the avoidance of
these evils the best that statesmanship could accomplish.

A Utopia, if seriously intended, obviously must embody the ideals of
its creator. Let us consider, for a moment, what we can mean by
"ideals." In the first place, they are desired by those who believe in
them; but they are not desired quite in the same way as a man desires
personal comforts, such as food and shelter. What makes the difference
between an "ideal" and an ordinary object of desire is that the former
is impersonal; it is something having (at least ostensibly) no special
reference to the ego of the man who feels the desire, and therefore
capable, theoretically, of being desired by everybody. Thus we might
define an "ideal" as something desired, not egocentric, and such that
the person desiring it wishes that every one else also desired it. I
may wish that everybody had enough to eat, that everybody felt kindly
towards everybody, and so on, and if I wish anything of this kind I
shall also wish others to wish it. In this way, I can build up what
looks like an impersonal ethic, although in fact it rests upon the
personal basis of my own desires for the desire remains mine, even
when what is desired has no reference to myself. For example, one man
may wish that everybody understood science, and another that everybody
appreciated an; it is a personal difference between the two men that
produces this difference in their desires.

The personal element becomes apparent as soon as controversy is
involved. Suppose some man says: "You are wrong to wish everybody to
be happy; you ought to desire the happiness of Germans and the
unhappiness of everyone else." Here "ought" may be taken to mean that
that is what the speaker wishes me to desire. I might retort that, not
being German, it is psychologically impossible for me to desire the
unhappiness of all non-Germans; but this answer seems inadequate.

Again, there may be a conflict of purely impersonal ideals.
Nietzsche's hero differs from a Christian saint, yet both are
impersonally admired, the one by Nietzscheans, the other by
Christians. How are we to decide between the two except by means of
our own desires? Yet, if there is nothing further, an ethical
disagreement can only be decided by emotional appeals, or by force in
the ultimate resort, by war. On questions of fact, we can appeal to
science and scientific methods of observation; but on ultimate
questions of ethics there seems to be nothing analogous. Yet, if this
is really the case, ethical disputes resolve themselves into contests
for power including propaganda power.

This point of view, in a crude form, is put forth in the first 
book of the _Republic_ by Thrasymachus, who, like almost all the 
characters in Plato's dialogues, was a real person. He was a 
Sophist from Chalcedon. and a famous teacher of rhetoric; he 
appeared in the first comedy of Aristophanes, 427 BC. After 
Socrates has, for some time, been amiably discussing justice with 
an old man named Cephalus, and with Plato's elder brothers 
Glaucon and Adeimantus, Thrasymachus, who has been listening 
with growing impatience, breaks in with a vehement protest 
against such childish nonsense. He proclaims emphatically that 
"justice is nothing else than the interest of the stronger." 

This point of view is refuted by Socrates with quibbles; it is never
fairly faced. It raises the fundamental question in ethics and
politics, namely: Is there any standard of "good" and "bad," except
what the man using these words desires? If there is not, many of the
consequences drawn by Thrasymachus seem unescapable. Yet how are we to
say that there is?

At this point, religion has, at first sight, a simple answer. God 
determines what is good and what bad; the man whose will is in 
harmony with the will of God is a good man. Yet this answer is 
not quite orthodox. Theologians say that God is good, and this 
implies that there is a standard of goodness which is independent 
of God's will. We are thus forced to face the question: Is there 
objective truth or falsehood in such a statement as "pleasure 
is good" in the same sense as in such a statement as "snow is 
white"? 

To answer this question, a very long discussion would be 
necessary. Some may think that we can, for practical purposes, 
evade the fundamental issue, and say: "I do not know what is 
meant by 'objective truth,' but I shall consider a statement 'true' 
if all, or virtually all, of those who have investigated it are agreed 
in upholding it." In this sense, it is "true" that snow is white, 
that Caesar was assassinated, that water is composed of hydrogen 
and oxygen, and so on. We are then faced with a question of fact: 
are there any similarly agreed statements in ethics? If there are, 
they can be made the basis both for rules of private conduct, 
and for a theory of politics. If there are not, we are driven in 
practice, whatever may be the philosophic truth, to a contest by 
force or propaganda or both, whenever an irreconcilable ethical 
difference exists between powerful groups. 

For Plato, this question does not really exist. Although his dramatic
sense leads him to state the position of Thrasymachus forcibly, he is
quite unaware of its strength, and allows himself to be grossly unfair
in arguing against it. Plato is convinced that there is "the Good,"
and that its nature can be ascertained; when people disagree about it,
one, at least, is making an intellectual, error just as much as if the
disagreement were a scientific one on some matter of fact.

The difference between Plato and Thrasymachus is very important, but
for the historian of philosophy it is one to be only noted, not
decided. Plato thinks he can prove that his ideal Republic is good; a
democrat who accepts the objectivity of ethics may think that he can
prove the Republic bad; but anyone who agrees with Thrasymachus will
say: "There is no question of proving or disproving; the only question
is whether you like the kind of State that Plato desires. If you do,
it is good for you; if you do not, it is bad for you. If many do and
many do not, the decision cannot be made by reason, but only by force,
actual or concealed." This is one of the issues in philosophy that are
still open; on each side there are men who command respect. But for a
very long time the opinion that Plato advocated remained almost
undisputed.

It should be observed, further, that the view which substitutes the
consensus of opinion for an objective standard has certain
consequences that few would accept. What are we to say of scientific
innovators like Galileo, who advocate an opinion with which few agree,
but finally win the support of almost everybody? They do so by means
of arguments, not by emotional appeals or state propaganda or the use
of force. This implies a criterion other than the general opinion. In
ethical matters, there is something analogous in the case of the great
religious teachers. Christ taught that it is not wrong to pluck ears
of corn on the Sabbath, but that it is wrong to hate your enemies.
Such ethical innovations obviously imply some standard other than
majority opinion, but the standard, whatever it is, is not objective
fact, as in a scientific question. This problem is a difficult one,
and I do not profess to be able to solve it. For the present, let us
be content to note it.

Plato's Republic, unlike modern Utopias, was perhaps intended 
to be actually founded. This was not so fantastic or impossible as 
it might naturally seem to us. Many of its provisions, including 
some that we should have thought quite impracticable, were 
actually realized at Sparta. The rule of philosophers had been 
attempted by Pythagoras, and in Plato's time Archytas the 
Pythagorean was politically influential in Taras (the modern 
Taranto) when Plato visited Sicily and southern Italy. It was 
a common practice for cities to employ a sage to draw up their 
laws; Solon had done this for Athens, and Protagoras for Thurii. 
Colonies, in those days, were completely free from control by 
their parent cities, and it would have been quite feasible for a 
band of Platonists to establish the Republic on the shores of Spain 
or Gaul. Unfortunately chance led Plato to Syracuse, a great 
commercial city engaged in desperate wars with Cartilage; in 
such an atmosphere, no philosopher could have achieved much. 
In the next generation, the rise of Macedonia had made all small 
States antiquated, and had brought about the futility of all 
political experiments in miniature. 

## Chapter XV THE THEORY OF IDEAS 

The middle of the _Republic_, from the later part of Book V 
to the end of Book VII, is occupied mainly with questions 
of pure philosophy, as opposed to politics. These questions 
are introduced by a somewhat abrupt statement: 

> Until philosophers are kings, or the kings and princes of this 
> world have the spirit and power of philosophy, and political
> greatness and wisdom meet in one, and those commoner natures who
> pursue either to the exclusion of the other are compelled to stand
> aside, cities will never have rest from these evils no, nor the
> human race, as I believe and then only will this our State have a
> possibility of life and behold the light of day.

If this is true, we must decide what constitutes a philosopher, 
and what we mean by "philosophy." The consequent discussion 
is the most famous part of the _Republic_, and has perhaps been the 
most influential. It has, in parts, extraordinary literary beauty; 
the reader may disagree (as I do) with what is said, but cannot 
help being moved by it. 

Plato's philosophy rests on the distinction between reality and 
appearance, which was first set forth by Parmenides; throughout 
the discussion with which we are now concerned, Parmenidean 
phrases and arguments are constantly recurring. There is, however, 
a religious tone about reality, which is rather Pythagorean than 
Parmenidean; and there is much about mathematics and music 
which is directly traceable to the disciples of Pythagoras. This 
combination of the logic of Parmenides with the other-worldliness 
of Pythagoras and the Orphics produced a doctrine which was 
felt to be satisfying to both the intellect and the religious emotions; the result was a very powerful synthesis, which, with various 
modifications, influenced most of the great philosophers, down 
to and including Hegel. But not only philosophers were influenced 
by Plato. Why did the Puritans object to the music and painting
and gorgeous ritual of the Catholic Church? You will find the
answer in the tenth book of the _Republic_. Why are children in
school compelled to learn arithmetic? The reasons are given in
the seventh book. 

The following paragraphs summarize Plato's theory of ideas. 

> Our question is: What is a philosopher? The first answer is in 
> accordance with the etymology: a philosopher is a lover of wisdom. 
> But this is not the same thing as a lover of knowledge, in the sense 
> in which an inquisitive man may be said to love knowledge; vulgar 
> curiosity does not make a philosopher. The definition is therefore 
> amended: the philosopher is a man who loves the "vision of truth." 
> But what is this vision? 

Consider a man who loves beautiful things, who makes a point 
of being present at new tragedies, seeing new pictures, and hearing 
new music. Such a man is not a philosopher, because he loves 
only beautiful things, whereas the philosopher loves beauty in 
itself. The man who only loves beautiful things is dreaming, 
whereas the man who knows absolute beauty is wide awake. 
The former has only opinion; the latter has knowledge. 

What is the difference between "knowledge" and "opinion"? The man who
has knowledge has knowledge of _something_, that is to say, of
something that exists, for what does not exist is nothing. (This is
reminiscent of Parmenides.) Thus knowledge is infallible, since it is
logically impossible for it to be mistaken. But opinion can be
mistaken. How can this be? Opinion cannot be of what is not, for that
is impossible; nor of what is, for then it would be knowledge.
Therefore opinion must be of what both is and is not.

But how is this possible? The answer is that particular things 
always partake of opposite characters: what is beautiful is also, 
in some respects, ugly; what is just is, in some respects, unjust; 
and so on. All particular sensible objects, so Plato contends, have 
this contradictory character; they are thus intermediate between 
being and not-being, and are suitable as objects of opinion, but 
not of knowledge. "But those who see the absolute and eternal 
and immutable may be said to know, and not to have opinion only." 
Thus we arrive at the conclusion that opinion is of the world 
presented to the senses, whereas knowledge is of a super-sensible 
eternal world; for instance, opinion is concerned with particular 
beautiful things, but knowledge is concerned with beauty in 
itself. 

The only argument advanced is that it is self-contradictory to suppose
that a thing can be both beautiful and not beautiful, or both just and
not just, and that nevertheless particular things seem to combine such
contradictory characters. Therefore particular things are not real.
Heraclitus had said "We step and do not step into the same rivers; we
are and are not." By combining this with Parmenides we arrive at
Plato's result.

There is, however, something of great importance in Plato's doctrine
which is not traceable to his predecessors, and that is the theory of
"ideas" or "forms." This theory is partly logical, partly
metaphysical. The logical part has to do with the meaning of general
words. There are many individual animals of whom we can truly say
"this is a cat." What do we mean by the word "cat"? Obviously
something different from each particular cat. An animal is a cat, it
would seem, because it participates in a general nature common to all
cats. Language cannot get on without general words such as "cat," and
such words are evidently not meaningless. But if the word "cat" means
anything, it means something which is not this or that cat, but some
kind of universal cattiness. This is not born when a particular cat is
born, and does not die when it dies. In fact, it has no position in
space or time; it is "eternal." This is the logical part of the
doctrine. The arguments in its favor, whether ultimately valid or
not, are strong, and quite independent of the metaphysical part of the
doctrine.

According to the metaphysical part of the doctrine, the word 
"cat" means a certain ideal cat, "the cat," created by God, and 
unique. Particular cats partake of the nature of the cat, but more 
or less imperfectly; it is only owing to this imperfection that 
there can be many of them. The cat is real; particular cats are 
only apparent. 

In the last book of the _Republic_, as a preliminary to a condemnation
of painters, there is a very clear exposition of the doctrine of ideas
or forms.

Here Plato explains that, whenever a number of individuals have a
common name, they have also a common "idea" or "form." For instance,
though there are many beds, there is only one "idea" or. "form" of a
bed. Just as a reflection of a bed in a mirror is only apparent and
not "real," so the various particular beds are unreal, being only
copies of the "idea," which is the one real bed, and is made by God.
Of this one bed, made by God, there can be knowledge, but in respect
of the many beds made by carpenters there can be only opinion. The
philosopher, as such, will be interested only in the one ideal bed,
not in the many beds found in the sensible world. He will have a
certain indifference to ordinary mundane affairs: "how can he who has
magnificence of mind and is the spectator of all time and all
existence, think much of human life?" The youth who is capable of
becoming a philosopher will be distinguished among his fellows as just
and gentle, fond of learning, possessed of a good memory and a
naturally harmonious mind. Such a one shall be educated into a
philosopher and a guardian.

At this point Adeimantus breaks in with a protest. When he tries 
to argue with Socrates, he says, he feels himself led a little astray 
at each step, until, in the end, all his former notions are turned 
upside down. But whatever Socrates may say, it remains the case, 
as any one can see, that people who stick to philosophy become 
strange monsters, not to say utter rogues; even the best of them 
are made useless by philosophy. 

Socrates admits that this is true in the world as it is, but maintains
that it is the other people who are to blame, not the philosophers; in
a wise community the philosophers would not seem foolish; it is only
among fools that the wise are judged to be destitute of wisdom.

What are we to do in this dilemma? There were to have been two ways of
inaugurating our Republic: by philosophers becoming rulers, or by
rulers becoming philosophers. The first way seems impossible as a
beginning, because in a city not already philosophic the philosophers
are unpopular. But a born prince might be a philosopher, and "one is
enough; let there be one man who has a city obedient to his will, and
he might bring into existence the ideal polity about which the world
is so incredulous." Plato hoped that he had found such a prince in the
younger Dionysius, tyrant of Syracuse, but the young man turned out
disappointingly.

In the sixth and seventh books of the _Republic_, Plato is concerned 
with two questions: First, what is philosophy? Second, how can a 
young man or woman, of suitable temperament, be so educated 
as to become a philosopher? 

Philosophy, for Plato, is a kind of vision, the "vision of truth." It
is not purely intellectual; it is not merely wisdom, but low of
wisdom. Spinoza's "intellectual love of God" is much the same intimate
union of thought and feeling. Every one who has done any kind of
creative work has experienced, in a greater or less degree, the state
of mind in which, after long labour, truth or beauty appears, or seems
to appear, in a sudden glory it may be only about some small matter,
or it may be about the universe. The experience is, at the moment,
very convincing; doubt may come later, but at the time there is utter
certainty. I think most of the best creative work, in art, in science,
in literature, and in philosophy, has been the result of such a
moment. Whether it comes to others as to me, I cannot say. For my pan,
I have found that, when I wish to write a book on some subject, I must
first soak myself in detail, until all the separate parts of the
subject-matter are familiar; then, some day, if I am fortunate, I
perceive the whole, with all its parts duly interrelated. After that,
I only have to write down what I have seen. The nearest analogy is
first walking all over a mountain in a mist, until every path and
ridge and valley is separately familiar, and then, from a distance,
seeing the mountain whole and clear in bright sunshine.

This experience, I believe, is necessary to good creative work, 
but it is not sufficient; indeed the subjective certainty that it 
brings with it may be fatally misleading. William James describes 
a man who got the experience from laughing-gas; whenever he 
was under its influence, he knew the secret of the universe, but 
when he came to, he had forgotten it. At last, with immense 
effort, he wrote down the secret before the vision had faded. 
When completely recovered, he rushed to see what he had written. 
It was: "A smell of petroleum prevails throughout." What seems 
like sudden insight may be misleading, and must be tested soberly, 
when the divine intoxication has passed. 

Plato's vision, which he completely trusted at the time when he 
wrote the _Republic_, needs ultimately the help of a parable, 
the parable of the cave, in order to convey its nature to the 
reader. But it is led up to by various preliminary discussions, 
designed to make the reader see the necessity of the world of 
ideas. 

First, the world of the intellect is distinguished from the world 
of the senses; then intellect and sense-perception are in turn each 
divided into two kinds. The two kinds of sense-perception need 
not concern us; the two kinds of intellect are called, respectively, 
"reason" and "understanding." Of these, reason is the higher 
kind; it is concerned with pure ideas, and its method is dialectic. 
Understanding is the kind of intellect that is used in mathematics; 
it is inferior to reason in that it uses hypotheses which it cannot 
test. In geometry, for example, we say: "Let ABC be a rectilinear 
triangle." It is against the rules to ask whether ABC really _is_ 
a rectilinear triangle, although, if it is a figure that we have drawn, 
we may be sure that it is not, because we can't draw absolutely 
straight lines. Accordingly, mathematics can never tell us what _is_, 
but only what would be if.... There are no straight lines in the 
sensible world; therefore, if mathematics is to have more than 
hypothetical truth, we must find evidence for the existence of 
super-sensible straight lines in a super-sensible world. This 
cannot be done by the understanding, but according to Plato 
it can be done by reason, which shows that there is a rectilinear 
triangle in heaven, of which geometrical propositions can be 
affirmed categorically, not hypothetically. 

There is, at this point, a difficulty which did not escape Plato's
notice, and was evident to modern idealistic philosophers. We saw that
God made only one bed, and it would he natural to suppose that he made
only one straight line. But if there is a heavenly triangle, he must
have made at least three straight lines. The objects of geometry,
though ideal, must exist in many examples; we need the possibility of
two intersecting circles , and so on. This suggests that geometry, on
Plato's theory, should not be capable of ultimate truth, but should be
condemned as part of the study of appearance. We will, however, ignore
this point, as to which Plato's answer is somewhat obscure.

Plato seeks to explain the difference between clear intellectual 
vision and the confused vision of sense-perception by an analogy 
from the sense of sight. Sight, he says, differs from the other senses, 
since it requires not only the eye and the object, hut also light. 
We see clearly objects on which the sun shines: in twilight we 
see confusedly, and in pitch-darkness not at all. Now the world 
of ideas is what we see when the object is illumined by the sun, 
while the world of passing things is a confused twilight world. 
The eye is compared to the soul, and the sun, as the source of 
light, to truth or goodness. 

> The soul is like an eye: when resting upon that on which truth and
> being shine, the soul perceives and understands, and is radiant with
> intelligence; but when turned towards the twilight of becoming and
> perishing, then she has opinion only, and goes blinking about, and
> is first of one opinion and then of another, and seems to have no
> intelligence.... Now what imparts truth to the known and the power
> of knowing to the knower is what I would have you term the idea of
> good, and this you will deem to be the cause of science.

This leads up to the famous simile of the cave or den, according to
which those who are destitute of philosophy may be compared to
prisoners in a cave, who are only able to look in one direction
because they are bound, and who have a fire behind them and a wall in
front. Between them and the wall there is nothing; all that they see
are shadows of themselves, and of objects behind them, cast on the
wall by the light of the fire. Inevitably they regard these shadows as
real, and have no notion of the objects to which they are due. At last
some man succeeds in escaping from the cave to the light of the sun;
for the first time he sees real things, and becomes aware that he had
hitherto been deceived by shadows. If he is the sort of philosopher
who is fit to become a guardian, he will feel it his duty to those who
were formerly his fellow-prisoners to go down again into the cave,
instruct them as to the truth, and show them the way up. But he will
have difficulty in persuading them, because, coming out of the
sunlight, he will see shadows less clearly than they do, and will seem
to them stupider than before his escape.

> And now, I said, let me show in a figure how far our nature is 
> enlightened or unenlightened: Behold! human beings living in 
> an underground den, which has a mouth open toward the light 
> and reaching all along the den; here they have been from their 
> childhood, and have their legs and necks chained so that they 
> cannot move, and can only see before them, being prevented by 
> the chains from turning round their heads. Above and behind 
> them a fire is blazing at a distance, and between the fire and the 
> prisoners there is a raised way; and you will see, if you look, a low 
> wall built along the way, like the screen which marionette players 
> have in front of them, over which they show the puppets. 
> 
> I see. 
>
> And do you see, I said, men passing along the wall carrying all 
> sorts of vessels, and statues and figures of animals made of wood 
> and stone and various materials, which appear over the wall? Some 
> of them arc talking, others silent. 
> 
> You have shown me a strange image, and they are strange prisoners. 
>
> Like ourselves, I replied; and they see only their own shadows, or
> the shadows of one another, which the fire throws on the opposite
> wall of the cave."

The position of the good in Plato's philosophy is peculiar. Science
and truth, he says, are like the good, but the good has a higher
place. "The good is not essence, but far exceeds essence in dignity
and power." Dialectic leads to the end of the intellectual world in
the perception of the absolute good. It is by means of the good that
dialectic is able to dispense with the hypotheses of the
mathematician. The underlying assumption is that reality, as opposed
to appearance, is completely and perfectly good; to perceive the good,
therefore, is to perceive reality. Throughout Plato's philosophy there
is the same fusion of intellect and mysticism as in Pythagoreanism,
but at this final culmination mysticism clearly has the upper hand.

Plato's doctrine of ideas contains a number of obvious errors. But in
spite of these it marks a very important advance in philosophy, since
it is the first theory to emphasize the problem of universal, which,
in varying forms, has persisted to the present day. Beginnings are apt
to be crude, but their originality should not be overlooked on this
account. Something remains of what Plato had to say, even after all
necessary corrections have been made. The absolute minimum of what
remains, even in the view of those most hostile to Plato, is this:
that we cannot express ourselves in a language composed wholly of
proper names, but must have also general words such as "man," "dog,"
"cat"; or, if not these, then relational words such as "similar,"
"before," and so on. Such words are not meaningless noises, and it is
difficult to see how they can have meaning if the world consists
entirely of particular things, such as are designated by proper names.
There may be ways of getting round this argument, but at any rate it
affords a prima facie case in favor of universals. I shall
provisionally accept it as in some degree valid. But when so much is
granted, the rest of what Plato says by no means follows.

In the first place, Plato has no understanding of philosophical
syntax. I can say "Socrates is human," "Plato is human," and so on. In
all these statements, it may be assumed that the word "human" has
exactly the same meaning. But whatever it means, it means something
which is not of the same kind as Socrates, Plato, and the rest of the
individuals who compose the human race. "Human" is an adjective; it
would be nonsense to say "human is human." Plato makes a mistake
analogous to saying "human is human." He thinks that beauty is
beautiful; he thinks that the universal "man" is the name of a pattern
man created by God, of whom actual men are imperfect and somewhat
unreal copies. He fails altogether to realize how great is the gap
between universals and particulars; his "ideas" are really just other
particulars, ethically and aesthetically superior to the ordinary
kind. He himself, at a later date, began to see this difficulty, as
appears in the _Parmenides_, which contains one of the most remarkable
cases in history of self-criticism by a philosopher.

The _Parmenides_ is supposed to be related by Antiphon (Plato's 
half-brother), who alone remembers the conversation, but is 
now only interested in horses. They find him carrying a bridle, 
and with difficulty persuade him to relate the famous discussion 
between Parmenides, Zeno, and Socrates. This, we are told, took 
place when Parmenides was old (about sixty-five), Zeno in middle 
life (about forty), and Socrates quite a young man. Socrates 
expounds the theory of ideas; he is sure that there are ideas of 
likeness, justices beauty, and goodness; he is not sure that there 
is an idea of man; and he rejects with indignation the suggestion 
that there could be ideas of such things as hair and mud and 
dirt though, he adds, there are times when he thinks that there 
is nothing without an idea. He runs away from this view because 
he is afraid of falling into a bottomless pit of nonsense. 

> Yes, Socrates, said Parmenides; that is because you are still 
> young; the time will come, if I am not mistaken, when philosophy 
> will have a firmer grasp of you, and then you will not despise 
> even the meanest things.

Socrates agrees that, in his view, "There are certain ideas of 
which ail other things partake, and from which they derive their 
names; that similars, for example, become similar, because they 
partake of similarity; and great things become great, because 
they partake of greatness; and that just and beautiful things 
become just and beautiful, because they partake of justice and 
beauty." 

Parmenides proceeds to raise difficulties, (a) Does the individual 
partake of the whole idea, or only of a part? To either view there 
are objections. If the former, one thing is in many places at once; 
if the latter, the idea is divisible, and a thing which has a part of 
smallness will be smaller than absolute smallness, which is absurd. 
(b) When an individual partakes of an idea, the individual and 
the idea are similar; therefore there will have to be another idea, 
embracing both the particulars and the original idea. And there 
will have to be yet another, embracing the particulars and the 
two ideas, and so on _ad infintium_. Thus every idea, instead of 
being one, becomes an infinite series of ideas. (This is the same 
as Aristotle's argument of the "third man.") (c) Socrates suggests 
that perhaps ideas are only thoughts, but Parmenides points 
out that thoughts must be of something, (d) Ideas cannot resemble 
the particulars that partake of them, for the reason given in (b) 
above. (e) Ideas, if there are any, must be unknown to us, because 
our knowledge is not absolute. (f) If God's knowledge is absolute, 
He will not know us, and therefore cannot rule us. 

Nevertheless, the theory of ideas is not wholly abandoned. Without
ideas, Socrates says, there will be nothing on which the mind can
rest, and therefore reasoning will be destroyed. Parmenides tells him
that his troubles come of lack of previous training, but no definite
conclusion is reached.

I do not think that Plato's logical objections to the reality of
sensible particulars will bear examination. He says, for example, that
whatever is beautiful is also in some respects ugly; what is double is
also half; and so on. But when we say of some work of art that it is
beautiful in some respects and ugly in others, analysis will always
(at least theoretically) enable us to say "this part or aspect is
beautiful, while that part or aspect is ugly." And as regards "double"
and "half," these are relative terms; there is no contradiction in the
fact that 2 is double of 1 and half of 4. Plato is perpetually getting
into trouble through not understanding relative terms. He thinks that
if A is greater than B and less than C, then A is at once great and
small, which seems to him a contradiction. Such troubles are among the
infantile diseases of philosophy.

The distinction between reality and appearance cannot have the
consequences attributed to it by Parmenides and Plato and Hegel. If
appearance really appears, it is not nothing, and is therefore pan of
reality; this is an argument of the correct Parmenidean sort. If
appearance does not really appear, why trouble our heads about it? But
perhaps some one will say: "Appearance does not really appear, but it
appears to appear." This will not help, for we shall ask again: "Does
it really appear to appear, or only apparently appear to appear?"
Sooner or later, if appearance is even to appear to appear, we must
reach something that really appears, and is therefore part of reality.
Plato would not dream of denying that there appear to be many beds,
although there is only one real bed, namely the one made by God. But
he does not seem to have faced the implications of the fact that there
are many appearances, and that this many-ness is part of reality. Any
attempt to divide the world into portions, of which one is more "real"
than the other, is doomed to failure.

Connected with this is another curious view of Plato's, that knowledge
and opinion must be concerned with different subject-matters. We
should say: If I think it is going to snow, that is opinion; if later
I see it snowing, that is knowledge; but the subject-matter is the
same on both occasions. Plato, however, thinks that what can at any
time be a matter of opinion can never be a matter of knowledge.
Knowledge is certain and infallible; opinion is not merely fallible,
but is necessarily mistaken, since it assumes the reality of what is
only appearance. All this repeats what had been said by Parmenides.

There is one respect in which Plato's metaphysic is apparently
different from that of Parmenides. For Parmenides there is only the
One; for Plato, there are many ideas. There are not only beauty,
truth, and goodness, but, as we saw, there is the heavenly bed,
created by God; there is a heavenly man, a heavenly dog, a heavenly
cat, and so on through a whole Noah's ark. All this however, seems, in
the _Republic_, to have been not adequately thought out. A Platonic
idea or form is not a thought, though it may be the object of a
thought. It is difficult to see how God can have created it, since its
being is timeless, and he could not have decided to create a bed
unless his thought, when he decided, had had for its object that very
Platonic bed which we are told he brought into existence. What is
timeless must be uncreated. We come here to a difficulty which has
troubled many philosophic theologians. Only the contingent world, the
world in space and time, can have been created; but this is the
everyday world which has been condemned as illusory and also bad.
Therefore the Creator, it would seem, created only illusion and evil.
Some Gnostics were so consistent as to adopt this view; but in Plato
the difficulty is still below the surface, and he seems, in the
_Republic_, to have never become aware of it.

The philosopher who is to be a guardian must, according to Plato,
return into the cave, and live among those who have never seen the sun
of truth. It would seem that God Himself, if He wishes to amend His
creation, must do likewise; a Christian Platonist might so interpret
the Incarnation. But it remains completely impossible to explain why
God was not content with the world of ideas. The philosopher finds the
cave in existence, and is actuated by benevolence in returning to it;
but the Creator, if He created everything, might, one would think,
have avoided the cave altogether.

Perhaps this difficulty arises only from the Christian notion of a
Creator, and is not chargeable to Plato, who says that God did not
create everything, but only what is good. The multiplicity of the
sensible world, on this view, would have some other source than God.
And the ideas would, perhaps, be not so much created by God as
constituents of His essence. The apparent pluralism involved in the
multiplicity of ideas would thus not be ultimate. Ultimately there is
only God, or the Good, to whom the ideas are adjectival. This, at any
rate, is a possible interpretation of Plato. Plato proceeds to an
interesting sketch of the education proper to a young man who is to be
a guardian. We saw that the young man is selected for this honor on
the ground of a combination of intellectual and moral qualities; he
must be just and gentle, fond of learning, with a good memory and a
harmonious mind. The young man who has been chosen for these merits
will spend the years from twenty to thirty on the four Pythagorean
studies: arithmetic, geometry (plane and solid), astronomy, and
harmony. These studies are not to be pursued in any utilitarian
spirit, but in order to prepare his mind for the vision of eternal
things. In astronomy, for example, he is not to trouble himself too
much about the actual heavenly bodies, but rather with the mathematics
of the motion of ideal heavenly bodies. This may sound absurd to
modern ears, but, strange to say, it proved to be a fruitful point of
view in connection with empirical astronomy. The way this came about
is curious, and worth considering.

The apparent motions of the planets, until they have been very
profoundly analyzed, appear to be irregular and complicated, and not
at all such as a Pythagorean Creator would have chosen. It was obvious
to every Greek that the heavens ought to exemplify mathematical
beauty, which would only be the case if the planets moved in circles.
This would be especially evident to Plato, owing to his emphasis on
the good. The problem thus arose: is there any hypothesis which will
reduce the apparent disorderliness of planetary motions to order and
beauty and simplicity? If there is, the idea of the good will justify
us in asserting this hypothesis. Aristarchus of Samos found such a
hypothesis: that all the planets, including the earth, go round the
sun in circles. This view was rejected for two thousand years, partly
on the authority of Aristotle, who attributes a rather similar
hypothesis to "the Pythagoreans" (_De Coelo_, 293 a). It was revived
by Copernicus, and its success might seem to justify Plato's aesthetic
bias in astronomy. Unfortunately, however, Kepler discovered that the
planets move in ellipses, not in circles, with the sun at a focus, not
at the center; then Newton discovered that they do not move even in
exact ellipses. And so the geometrical simplicity sought by Plato, and
apparently found by Aristarchus of Samos, proved in the end illusory.

This piece of scientific history illustrates a general maxim: that 
any hypothesis, however absurd, may be useful in science, if it 
enables a discoverer to conceive things in a new way; but that, 
when it has served this purpose by luck, it is likely to become an 
obstacle to further advance. The belief in the good as the key to 
the scientific understanding of the world was useful, at a certain 
stage, in astronomy, but at every later stage it was harmful. The 
ethical and aesthetic bias of Plato, and still more of Aristotle, 
did much to kill Greek science. 

It is noteworthy that modern Platonists, with few exceptions, 
are ignorant of mathematics, in spite of the immense importance 
that Plato attached to arithmetic and geometry, and the immense 
influence that they had on his philosophy. This is an example 
of the evils of specialization: a man must not write on Plato unless 
he has spent so much of his youth on Greek as to have had no 
time for the things that Plato thought important. 

## Chapter XVI PLATO'S THEORY OF IMMORTALITY

The dialogue called after Phaedo is interesting in several respects.
It purports to describe the last moments in the life of Socrates: his
conversation immediately before drinking the hemlock, and after, until
he loses consciousness. This presents Plato's ideal of a man who is
both wise and good in the highest degree, and who is totally without
fear of death. Socrates in face of death, as represented by Plato, was
important ethically, both in ancient and in modern times. What the
gospel account of the Passion and the Crucifixion was for Christians,
The _Phaedo_ was for pagan or free-thinking philosophers.[^56] But the
imperturbability of Socrates in his last hour is bound up with his
belief in immortality, and the _Phaedo_ is important as setting forth,
not only the death of a martyr, but also many doctrines which were
afterwards Christian. The theology of St Paul and of the Fathers was
largely derived from it, directly or indirectly, and can hardly be
understood if Plato is ignored.

[^56]: Even for many Christians, it is second only to the death of Christ. "There is nothing in any tragedy, ancient or modern, nothing in poetry or history (with one exception), like the last hours of Socrates in Plato." These are the words of the Rev. Benjamin Jowett.


An earlier dialogue, the _Crito_, tells how certain friends and
disciples of Socrates arranged a plan by which he could escape to
Thessaly. Probably the Athenian authorities would have been quite glad
if he had escaped, and the scheme suggested may be assumed to have
been very likely to succeed. Socrates, however, would have none of it.
He contended that he had been condemned by due process of law, and
that it would be wrong to do anything illegal to avoid punishment. He
first proclaimed the principle which we associate with the Sermon on
the Mount, that "we ought not to retaliate evil for evil to any one,
whatever evil we may have suffered from him". He then imagines himself
engaged in a dialogue with the laws of Athens, in which they point out
that he owes them the kind of respect that a son owes to a father or a
slave to his master, but in an even higher degree; and that, moreover,
every Athenian citizen is free to emigrate if he dislikes the Athenian
state. The laws end a long speech with the words:

> Listen, then, Socrates, to us who have brought you up. Think not of
> life and children first, and of justice afterwards, but of justice
> first, that you may be justified before the princes of the world
> below. For neither will you nor any that belong to you be happier or
> holier or juster in this life, or happier in another, if you do as
> Crito bids. Now you depart in innocence, a sufferer and not a doer
> of evil; a victim, not of the laws, but of men. But if you go forth,
> returning evil for evil, and injury for injury, breaking the
> covenants and agreement which you have made with us, and wronging
> those whom you ought least of all to wrong, that is to say,
> yourself, your friends, your country, and us, we shall be angry with
> you while you live, and our brethren, the laws in the world below,
> will receive you as an enemy; for they will know that you have done
> your best to destroy us.

This voice, Socrates says, "I seem to hear humming in my ears like the
sound of the flute in the ears of the mystic." He decides accordingly,
that it is his duty to stay and abide the death sentence.

In the _Phaedo_, the last hour has come; his chains are taken off, and
he is allowed to converse freely with his friends. He sends away his
weeping wife, in order that her grief may not interfere with the
discussion.

Socrates begins by maintaining that, though any one who has the spirit
of philosophy will not fear death, but, on the contrary, will welcome
it, yet he will not take his own life, for that is held to be
unlawful. His friends inquire why suicide is held to be unlawful, and
his answer, which is in accordance with Orphic doctrine, is almost
exactly what a Christian might say. "There is a doctrine whispered in
secret that many is a prisoner who has no right to open the door and
run away; this is a great mystery which I do not quite understand." He
compares the relation of man to God with that of cattle to their
owner; you would be angry, he says, if your ox took the liberty of
putting himself out of the way, and so "there may be reason in saying
that a man should wait, and not take his own life until God summons
him, as He is now summoning me". He is not grieved at death, because
he is convinced "in the first place that I am going to other gods who
are wise and good (of which I am as certain as I can be of such
matters) and secondly (though I am not so sure of this last) to men
departed better than those whom I leave behind. I have good hope that
there is yet something remaining for the dead, some far better thing
for the good than for the evil."

Death, says Socrates, is the separation of soul and body. Here we come
under Plato's dualism: between reality and appearance, ideas and
sensible objects, reason and sense-perception, soul and body. These
pairs are connected: the first in each pair is superior to the second
both in reality and in goodness. An ascetic morality was the natural
consequence of this dualism. Christianity adopted this doctrine in
part, but never wholly. There were two obstacles. The first was that
the creation of the visible world, if Plato was right, might seem to
have been an evil deed, and therefore the Creator could not be good.
The second was that orthodox Christianity could never bring itself to
condemn marriage, though it held celibacy to be nobler. The
Manichaeans were more consistent in both respects.

The distinction between mind and matter, which has become 
a commonplace in philosophy and science and popular thought, 
has a religious origin, and began as the distinction of soul and body. 
The Orphic, as we saw, proclaims himself the child of earth and 
of the starry heaven; from earth comes the body, from heaven the 
soul. It is this theory that Plato seeks to express in the language 
of philosophy. 

Socrates, in the _Phaedo_, proceeds at once to develop the ascetic 
implications of his doctrine, but his asceticism is of a moderate and 
gentlemanly sort. He does not say that the philosopher should 
wholly abstain from ordinary pleasures, but only that he should 
not be a slave to them. The philosopher should not care about 
eating and drinking, but of coune he should eat as much as is 
necessary; there is no suggestion of fasting. And we are told that 
Socrates, though indifferent to wine, could, on occasion, drink 
more than anybody else, without ever becoming intoxicated. 
It was not drinking that he condemned, but pleasure in drinking. 
In like manner, the philosopher must not care for the pleasures 
of love, or for costly raiment, or sandals, or other adornments 
of the person. He must be entirely concerned with the soul, 
and not with the body. "He would like, as far as he can, to get 
away from the body and to turn to the soul." 

It is obvious that this doctrine, popularized, would become 
ascetic, but in intention it is not, properly speaking, ascetic. 
The philosopher will not abstain with an effort from the pleasures 
of sense, but will be thinking of other things. I have known many 
philosophers who forgot their meals, and read a book when at 
last they did eat. These men were acting as Plato says they should: 
they were not abstaining from gluttony by means of a moral 
effort, but were more interested in other matters. Apparently 
the philosopher should marry, and beget and rear children, in 
the same absent-minded way, but since the emancipation of 
women this has become more difficult. No wonder Xanthippe 
was a shrew. 

Philosophers, Socrates continues, try to dissever the soul from
communion with the body, whereas other people think that life is not
worth living for a man who has "no sense of pleasure and no part in
bodily pleasure." In this phrase, Plato seems perhaps inadvertently to
countenance the view of a certain class of moralists, that bodily
pleasures are the only ones that count. These moralists hold that the
man who does not seek the pleasures of sense must be eschewing
pleasure altogether, and living virtuously. This is an error which has
done untold harm. In so far as the division of mind and body can be
accepted, the worst pleasures, as well as the best, are mental for
example, envy, and many forms of cruelty and love of power. Milton's
Satan rises superior to physical torment, and devotes himself to a
work of destruction from which he derives a pleasure that is wholly of
the mind. Many eminent ecclesiastics, having renounced the pleasures
of sense, and not being on their guard against others, become
dominated by love of power, which led them to appalling cruelties and
persecutions, nominally for the sake of religion. In our own day,
Hitler belongs to this type; by all accounts, the pleasures of sense
are of very little importance to him. Liberation from the tyranny of
the body contributes to greatness, but just as much to greatness in
sin as to greatness in virtue.

This, however, is a digression, from which we must return to 
Socrates. 

We come now to the intellectual aspect of the religion which Plato
(rightly or wrongly) attributes to Socrates. We are told that the body
is a hindrance in the acquisition of knowledge, and that sight and
hearing are inaccurate witnesses: true existence, if revealed to the
soul at all, is revealed in thought, not in sense. Le us consider, for
a moment, the implications of this doctrine. It involves a complete
rejection of empirical knowledge, including all history and geography.
We cannot know that there was such a place as Athens, or such a man as
Socrates; his death, and his courage in dying, belong to the world of
appearance. It is only through sight and hearing that we know anything
about all this, and the true philosopher ignores sight and hearing.
What, then, is left to him? First, logic and mathematics; but these
are hypothetical, and do not justify any categorical assertion about
the real world. The next step and this is the crucial one depends upon
the idea of the good. Having arrived at this idea, the philosopher is
supposed to know that the good is the real, and thus to be able to
infer that the world of ideas is the real world. Later philosophers
had arguments to prove the identity of the real and the good, but
Plato seems to have assumed it as self-evident. If we wish to
understand him, we must, hypothetically, suppose this assumption
justified.

Thought is best, Socrates says, when the mind is gathered into 
itself, and is not troubled by sounds or sights or pain or pleasure 
but takes leave of the body and aspires after true being; "and in 
this the philosopher dishonors the body." From this point, 
Socrates goes on to the ideas or forms or essences. There is 
absolute justice, absolute beauty, and absolute good, but they are 
not visible to the eye. "And I speak not of these alone, but of 
absolute greatness, and health, and strength, and of the essence 
or true nature of everything." All these are only to be seen by 
intellectual vision. Therefore while we are in the body, and while 
the soul is infected with the evils of the body, our desire for truth 
will not be satisfied. 

This point of view excludes scientific observation and experiment as
methods for the attainment of knowledge. The experimenter's mind is
not "gathered into itself," and docs not aim at avoiding sounds or
sights. The two kinds of mental activity that can be pursued by the
method that Plato recommends are mathematics and mystic insight. This
explains how these two come to be so intimately combined in Plato and
the Pythagoreans.

To the empiricist, the body is what brings us into touch with the
world of external reality, bat to Plato it is doubly evil, as a
distorting medium, causing us to see as through a glass darkly, and as
a source of lusts which distract us from the pursuit of knowledge and
the vision of truth. Some quotations will make this clear.

The founders of the mysteries would appear to have had a real 
meaning, and were not talking nonsense when they intimated in 
a figure long ago that he who passes unsanctified and uninitiated 
into the world below will lie on a slough, but that he who arrives 
there after initiation and purification will dwell with the gods. 
For many, as they say in the mysteries, are the thyrsus-bearers, but 
few are the mystics, meaning, as I interpret the words, the true 
philosophers. 

All this language is mystical, and is derived from the mysteries.
"Purity" is an Orphic conception, having primarily a ritual meaning,
but for Plato it means freedom from slavery to the body and its needs.
It it interesting to find him saying that wars are caused by love of
money, and that money is only needed for the service of the body. The
first half of this opinion is the same as that held by Marx, but the
second belongs to a very different outlook. Plato thinks that a man
could live on very little money if his wants were reduced to a
minimum, and this no doubt is true. But he also thinks that a
philosopher should be exempt from manual labour; he must therefore
live on wealth created by others. In a very poor State there are
likely to be no philosophers. It was the imperialism of Athens in the
age of Pericles that made it possible for Athenians to study
philosophy. Speaking broadly, intellectual goods are just as expensive
as more material commodities, and just as little independent of
economic conditions. Science requires libraries, laboratories,
telescopes, microscopes, and so on, and men of science have to be
supported by the labour of others. But to the mystic all this is
foolishness. A holy man in India or Tibet needs no apparatus, wears
only a loin cloth, eats only rice, and is supported by very meagre
charity because he is thought wise. This is the logical development of
Plato's point of view.

To return to the _Phaedo_: Cebes expresses doubt as to the survival of
the soul after death, and urges Socrates to offer arguments. This he
proceeds to do, but it must be said that the arguments are very poor.

The first argument is that all things which have opposites are 
generated from their opposites a statement which reminds us of 
Anaximander's views on cosmic justice. Now life and death are 
opposites, and therefore each must generate the other. It follows 
that the souk of the dead exist somewhere, and come back to 
earth in due course. St. Paul's statement, "the seed is not 
quickened except it die," seems to belong to some such theory as 
this. 

The second argument is that knowledge is recollection, and therefore
the soul must have existed before birth. The theory that knowledge is
recollection is supported chiefly by the fact that we have ideas, such
as exact equality, which cannot be derived from experience. We have
experience of approximate equality, but absolute equality is never
found among sensible objects, and yet we know what we mean by
"absolute equality." Since we have not learnt this from experience, we
must have brought the knowledge with us from a previous existence. A
similar argument, he says, applies to all other ideas. Thus the
existence of essences, and our capacity to apprehend them, proves the
pre-existence of the soul with knowledge.

The contention that all knowledge is reminiscence is developed at
greater length in the _Meno_ (82 ff.). Here Socrates says "there is no
teaching, but only recollection." He professes to prove his point by
having Meno call in a slave-boy whom Socrates proceeds to question on
geometrical problems. The boy's answers are supposed to show that he
really knows geometry, although he has hitherto been unaware of
possessing this knowledge. The same conclusion is drawn in the _Meno_ as
in the _Phaedo_, that knowledge is brought by the soul from a previous
existence.

As to this, one may observe, in the first place, that the argument 
is wholly inapplicable to empirical knowledge. The slave-boy 
could not have been led to "remember" when the Pyramids were 
built, or whether the siege of Troy really occurred, unless he had 
happened to be present at these events. Only the sort of knowledge 
that is called a priori especially logic and mathematics can be 
possibly supposed to exist in every one independently of experience. 
In fact, this is the only sort of knowledge (apart from mystic 
insight) that Plato admits to be really knowledge. Let us see how 
the argument can be met in regard to mathematics. 

Take the concept of equality. We must admit that we have no 
experience, among sensible objects, of exact equality; we see only 
approximate equality. How, then, do we arrive at the idea of 
absolute equality? Or do we, perhaps, have no such idea? 

Let us take a concrete case. The meter is defined as the length of a
certain rod in Paris at a certain temperature. What should we mean if
we said, of some other rod, that its length was exactly one meter? I
don't think we should mean anything. We could say: The most accurate
processes of measurement known to science at the present day fail to
show that our rod is either longer or shorter than the standard meter
in Paris. We might, if we were sufficiently rash, add a prophecy that
no subsequent refinements in the technique of measurement will alter
this result. But this is still an empirical statement, in the sense
that empirical evidence may at any moment disprove it. I do not think
we really possess the idea of absolute equality that Plato supposes us
to possess.

But even if we do, it is clear that no child possesses it until it 
reaches a certain age, and that the idea is elicited by experience, 
although not directly derived from experience. Moreover, unless 
our existence before birth was not one of sense-perception, it 
would have been as incapable of generating the idea as this life 
is; and if our previous existence is supposed to have been partly 
super-sensible, why not make the same supposition concerning 
our present existence? On all these grounds, the argument fails. 

The doctrine of reminiscence being considered established, Cebes says:
"About half of what was required has been proven; to wit, that our
souls existed before we were born: that the soul will exist after
death as well as before birth is the other half of which the proof is
still wanting." Socrates accordingly applies himself to this. He says
that it follows from what was said about everything being generated
from its opposite, according to which death must generate life just as
much as life generates death. But he adds another argument, which had
a longer history in philosophy: that only what is complex can be
dissolved, and that the soul, like the ideas, is simple and not
compounded of parts. What is simple, it is thought, cannot begin or
end or change. Now essences are unchanging: absolute beauty, for
example, is always the same, whereas beautiful things continually
change. Thus things seen are temporal, but things unseen are eternal.
The body is seen, but the soul is unseen; therefore the soul is to be
classified in the group of things that are eternal.

The soul, being eternal, is at home in the contemplation of eternal
things, that is, essences, but is lost and confused when, as in
sense-perception, it contemplates the world of changing things.

> The soul, when using the body as an instrument of perception, that
> is to say, when using the sense of sight or hearing or some other
> sense (for the meaning of perceiving through the body is perceiving
> through the senses) ... is then dragged by the body into the region
> of the changeable, and wanders and is confused; the world spins
> round her, and she is like a drunkard, when she touches change....
> But when returning into herself she reflects, then she passes into
> the other world, the region of purity, and eternity, and
> immortality, and unchangeableness, which arc her kindred, and with

> soul is called wisdom.

The soul of the true philosopher, which has, in life, been liberated
from thralldom to the flesh, will, after death, depart to the invisible
world, to live in bliss in the company of the gods. But the impure
soul, which has loved the body, will become a ghost haunting the
sepulcher, or will enter into the body of an animal, such as an ass or
wolf or hawk, according to its character. A man who has been virtuous
without being a philosopher will become a bee or wasp or ant, or some
other animal of a gregarious and social sort.

Only the true philosopher goes to heaven when he dies. "No 
one who has not studied philosophy and who is not entirely pure 
at the time of his departure is allowed to enter the company of 
the Gods, but the lover of knowledge only." That is why the true 
votaries of philosophy abstain from fleshly lusts: not that they 
fear poverty or disgrace, but because they "are conscious that the 
soul was simply fastened or glued to the body until philosophy 
received her, she could only view real existence through the bars 
of a prison, not in and through herself,...and by reason of lust 
had become the principal accomplice in her own captivity." The 
philosopher will be temperate because "each pleasure and pain 
is a sort of nail which nails and rivets the soul to the body, until 
she becomes like the body, and believes that to be true which the 
body affirms to be true." 

At this point, Simmias brings up the Pythagorean opinion that 
the soul is a harmony, and urges: if the lyre is broken, can the 
harmony survive? Socrates replies that the soul is not a harmony, 
for a harmony is complex, but the soul is simple. Moreover, he 
says, the view that the soul is a harmony is incompatible with its 
pre-existence, which was proved by the doctrine of reminiscence; 
for the harmony does not exist before the lyre. 

Socrates proceeds to give an account of his own philosophical 
development, which is very interesting, but not germane to the 
main argument. He goes on to expound the doctrine of ideas, 
leading to the conclusion "that ideas exist, and that other things 
participate in them and derive their names from them." At last 
lie describes the fate of souls after death: the good go to heaven, 
the bad to hell, the intermediate to purgatory. 

His end, and his farewells, are described. His last words are: 
"Crito, I owe a cock to Asclepius; will you remember to pay the 
debt?" Men paid a cock to Asclepius when they recovered from 
tn illness, and Socrates has recovered from life's fitful fever. 

"Of all the men of his time," Phaedo concludes, "he was the 
wisest and justest and best." 

The Platonic Socrates was a pattern to subsequent philosophers for
many ages. What are we to think of him ethically? (I am concerned only
with the man as Plato portrays him.) His merits are obvious. He is
indifferent to worldly success, so devoid of fear that he remains calm
and urbane and humorous to the last moment, caring more for what he
believes to be truth than for anything else whatever. He has, however,
some very grave defects. He is dishonest and sophistical in argument,
and in his private thinking he uses intellect to prove conclusions
that are to him agreeable, rather than in a disinterested search for
knowledge. There is something smug and unctuous about him, which
reminds one of a bad type of cleric. His courage in the face of death
would have been more remarkable if he had not believed that he was
going to enjoy eternal bliss in the company of the gods. Unlike some
of his predecessors, he was not scientific in his thinking, but was
determined to prove the universe agreeable to his ethical standards.
This is treachery to truth, and the worst of philosophic sins. As a
man, we may believe him admitted to the communion of saints; but as a
philosopher he needs a long residence in a scientific purgatory.

## Chapter XVII PLATO'S COSMOGONY 

Plato's cosmogony is set forth in the _Timaeus_,[^57] which was
translated into Latin by Cicero, and was, moreover, the only one of
the dialogues that was known in the West in the Middle Ages. Both
then, and earlier in Neoplatonism, it had more influence than anything
else in Plato, which is curious, as it certainly contains more that is
simply silly than is to be found in his other writings. As philosophy,
it is unimportant, but historically it was so influential that it must
be considered in some detail.

[^57]: This dialogue contains much that is obscure and has given rise to controversies among commentators. On the whole, I find myself in most agreement with Cornford's admirable book, _Plato's Cosmology_. 

The place occupied by Socrates in the earlier dialogues is taken, in
the _Timaeus_, by a Pythagorean, and the doctrines of that school are
in the main adopted, including (up to a point) the view that number-is
the explanation of the world. There is first a summary of the first
five books of the _Republic_, then the myth of Atlantis, which is said
to have been an island off the Pillars of Hercules, larger than Libya
and Asia put together. Then Timaeus, who is a Pythagorean astronomer,
proceeds to tell the history of the world down to the creation of man.
What he says is, in outline, as follows. What is unchanging is
apprehended by intelligence and reason; what is changing is
apprehended by opinion. The world, being sensible, cannot be eternal,
and must have been created by God. Since God is good, He made the
world after the pattern of the eternal; being without jealousy, He
wanted everything as like Himself as possible. "God desired that all
things should be good, and nothing bad, as far as possible." "Finding
the whole visible sphere not at rest, but moving in an irregular and
disorderly fashion, out of disorder he brought order." (Thus it
appears that Plato's God, unlike the Jewish and Christian God, did not
create the world out of nothing, but rearranged pre-existing
material.) He put intelligence in the soul, and the soul in the body.
He made the world as a whole a living creature having soul and
intelligence. There is only one world, not many, as various
pre-Socratics had taught; there cannot be more than one, since it is a
created copy designed to accord as closely as possible with the
eternal original apprehended by God. The world in its entirety is one
visible animal, comprehending within itself all other animals. It is a
globe, because like is fairer than unlike, and only a globe is alike
everywhere. It rotates, because circular motion is the most perfect;
and since this is its only motion it needs no feet or hands.

The four elements, fire, air, water, and earth, each of which
apparently is represented by a number, are in continued proportion,
i.e. fire is to air as air is to water and as water is to earth. God
used all the elements in making the world, and therefore it is
perfect, and not liable to old age or disease. It is harmonized by
proportion, which causes it to have the spirit of friendship, and
therefore to be indissoluble except by God.

God made first the soul, then the body. The soul is compounded of the
indivisible-unchangeable and the divisible-changeable; it is a third
and intermediate kind of essence.

Here follows a Pythagorean account of the planets, leading to an
explanation of the origin of time:

> When the father and creator saw the creature which he had made
> moving and living, the created image of the eternal gods, he
> rejoiced, and in his joy determined to make the copy still more like
> the original; and as this was eternal, he sought to make the
> universe eternal, so far as might be. Now the nature of the ideal
> being was everlasting, but to bestow this attribute in its fulness
> upon a creature was impossible. Wherefore he resolved to have a
> moving image of eternity, and when be set in order the heaven, he
> made this image eternal but moving according to number, while
> eternity itself rests in unity; and this image we call Time.[^58]

[^58]: Vaughan must have been reading this passage when he wrote the poem beginning "I saw eternity the other night." 

Before this, there were no days or nights. Of the eternal essence 
we must not say that it _was_ or _will be_; only _is_ is correct. It is implied 
that of the "moving image of eternity" it is correct to say that it 
was and will be. 

Time and the heavens came into existence at the same instant. 
God made the sun so that animals could learn arithmetic without 
the succession of days and nights, one supposes, we should not 
have thought of numbers. The sight of day and night, months 
and years, has created knowledge of number and given us the 
conception of time, and hence came philosophy. This is the 
greatest boon we owe to sight. 

There are (apart from the world as a whole) four kinds of 
animals: gods, birds, fishes, and land animals. The gods are 
mainly fire; the fixed stars are divine and eternal animals. The 
Creator told the gods that he could destroy them, but would not 
do so. He left it to them to make the mortal part of all other 
animals, after he had made the immortal and divine part. (This, 
like other passages about the gods in Plato, is perhaps not to be 
taken very seriously. At the beginning, Timaeus says he seeks 
only probability, and cannot be sure. Many details are obviously 
imaginative, and not meant literally.) 

The Creator, Timaeus says, made one soul for each star. Souls have
sensation, love, fear, and anger; if they overcome these, they live
righteously, but if not, not. If a man lives well, he goes, after
death, to live happily for ever in his star. But if he lives badly, he
will, in the next life, be a woman; if he (or she) persists in
evil-doing, he (or she) will become a brute, and go on through
transmigrations until at last reason conquers. God put some souls on
earth, some on the moon, some on other planets and stars, and left it
to the gods to fashion their bodies.


There are two kinds of causes, those that are intelligent, and those
that, being moved by others, are, in turn, compelled to move others.
The former are endowed with mind, and are the workers of things fair
and good, while the latter produce chance effects without order or
design. Both sorts ought to be studied, for the creation is mixed,
being made up of necessity and mind. (It will be observed that
necessity is not subject to God's power.) Timaeus now proceeds to deal
with the part contributed by necessity.[^59]

[^59]: Cornford (_op. cit._) points out that "necessity" is not to be confounded with the modern conception of a deterministic reign of law. The things that happen through "necessity" are those not brought about by a purpose: they are chaotic and not subject to laws. 

Earth, air, fire, and water are not the first principles or letters 
or elements; they are not even syllables or first compounds. Fire, 
for instance, should not be called this, but such that is to say, it 
is not a substance, but rather a state of substance. At this point, 
the question is raised: are intelligible essences only names? The 
answer turns, we are told, on whether mind is or is not the same 
thing as true opinion. If it is not, knowledge must be knowledge 
of essences, and therefore essences cannot be mere names. Now 
mind and true opinion certainly differ, for the one is implanted 
by instruction, the other by persuasion; one is accompanied by 
true reason, the other is not; all men share in true opinion, 
but mind is the attribute of the gods and of a very few among 
men. 

This leads to a somewhat curious theory of space, as something 
intermediate between the world of essence and the world of 
transient sensible things. 

> There is one kind of being which is always the same, uncreated and
> indestructible, never receiving anything into itself from without,
> nor itself going out to any other, but invisible and imperceptible

This is a very difficult passage, which I do not pretend to understand
at all fully. The theory expressed must, I think, have arisen from
reflection on geometry, which appeared to be a matter of pure reason,
like arithmetic, and yet had to do with space, which was an aspect of
the sensible world. In general it is fanciful to find analogies with
later philosophers, but I cannot help thinking that Kant must have
liked this view of space, as one having an affinity with his own.

The true elements of the material world, Timaeus says, are not earth,
air, fire, and water, but two sorts of right-angled triangles, the one
which is half a square and the one which is half an equilateral
triangle. Originally everything was in confusion, and "the various
elements had different places before they were arranged so as to form
the universe." But then God fashioned them by form and number, and
"made them as far as possible the fairest and best, out of things
which were not fair and good." The above two sorts of triangles, we
are told, are the most beautiful forms and therefore God used them in
constructing matter. By means of these two triangles, it is possible
to construct four of the five regular solids, and each atom of one of
the four elements is a regular solid. Atoms of earth are cubes; of
fire, tetrahedra; of air, octahedra; and of water, icosahedra. (I
shall come to the dodecahedron presently.)

The theory of the regular solids, which is set forth in the 
thirteenth book of Euclid, was, in Plato's day, a recent discovery; 
it was completed by Theaetetus, who appears as a very young 
man in the dialogue that bears his name. It was, according to 
tradition, he who first proved that there are only five kinds of 
regular solids, and discovered the octahedron and the icosahedron.[^60]
The regular tetrahedron, octahedron, and icosahedron, have 
equilateral triangles for their faces; the dodecahedron has regular 
pentagons, and cannot therefore be constructed out of Plato's two 
triangles. For this reason he does not use it in connection with the 
four elements. 

[^60]: See Heath, _Greek Mathematics_, Vol. 1, pp. 159, 162, 294-296. 

As for the dodecahedron, Plato says only "there was yet a fifth 
combination which God used in the delineation of the universe." 
This is obscure, and suggests that the universe is a dodecahedron; 
but elsewhere it is said to be a sphere.[^61] The pentagram has always 
been prominent in magic, and apparently owes this position to the 
Pythagoreans, who called it '"Health" and used it as a symbol of 
recognition of members of the brotherhood.[^62] It seems that it owed 
its properties to the fact that the dodecahedron has pentagons for 
its faces, and is, in some sense, a symbol of the universe. This 
topic is attractive, but it is difficult to ascertain much that is 
definite about it. 

[^61]: For a reconciliation of the two statements, see Cornford, _op. cit._, p. 219. 
[^62]: Heath, _op. cit._, p. 161. 

After a discussion of sensation, Timaeus proceeds to explain the two
souls in man, one immortal, the other mortal, one created by God, the
other by the gods. The mortal soul is "subject to terrible and
irresistible affections first of all, pleasure, the greatest
incitement to evil; then pain, which deters from good; also rashness
and fear, two foolish counsellors, anger hard to be appeased, and hope
easily led astray; these they (the gods) mingled with irrational sense
and with all-daring love according to necessary laws, and so framed
men."

The immortal soul is in the head, the mortal in the breast. 

There is some curious physiology, as, that the purpose of the 
intestines is to prevent gluttony by keeping the food in, and then 
there is another account of transmigration. Cowardly or unrighteous men will, in the next life, be women. Innocent light-minded men, who think that astronomy can be learnt by looking 
at the stars without knowledge of mathematics, will become birds; 
those who have no philosophy will become wild land-animals; 
the very stupidest will become fishes. 

The last paragraph of the dialogue sums it up: 

> We may now say that our discourse about the nature of the universe
> has an end. The world has received animals, mortal and immortal, and
> is fulfilled with them, and has become a visible animal containing
> the visible---the sensible God who is the image of the intellectual,
> the greatest, best, fairest, most perfect---the one only-begotten
> heaven.

It is difficult to know what to take seriously in the _Timaeus_, and
what to regard as play of fancy. I think the account of the creation
as bringing order out of chaos is to be taken quite seriously; so also
is the proportion between the four elements, and their relation to the
regular solids and their constituent triangles. The accounts of time
and space are obviously what Plato believes, and so is the view of the
created world as a copy of an eternal archetype. The mixture of
necessity and purpose in the world is a belief common to practically
all Greeks, long antedating the rise of philosophy; Plato accepted it,
and thus avoided the problem of evil, which troubles Christian
theology. I think his world-animal is seriously meant. But the details
about transmigration, and the pan attributed to the gods, and other
inessentials, are, I think, only put in to give a possible
concreteness.

The whole dialogue, as I said before, deserves to he studied 
because of its great influence on ancient and medieval thought; 
and this influence is not confined to what is least fantastic. 

## Chapter XVIII KNOWLEDGE AND PERCEPTION IN PLATO 

Most modern men take it for granted that empirical knowledge is
dependent upon, or derived from, perception. There is however in Plato
and among philosophers of certain other schools a very different
doctrine, to the effect that there is nothing worthy to be called
"knowledge" to be derived from the senses, and that the only real
knowledge has to do with concepts. In this view, "2 + 2 = 4" is
genuine knowledge, but such a statement as "snow is white" is so full
of ambiguity and uncertainty that it cannot find a place in the
philosopher's corpus of truths.

This view is perhaps traceable to Parmenides, but in its explicit
form the philosophic world owes it to Plato. I propose, in this
chapter, to deal with Plato's criticism of the view that knowledge is
the same thing as perception, which occupies the first half of the
Theaetetus.

This dialogue is concerned to find a definition of "knowledge," 
but ends without arriving at any but a negative conclusion; 
several definitions are proposed and rejected, but no definition 
that is considered satisfactory is suggested. 

The first of the suggested definitions, and the only one that I 
shall consider, is set forth by Theaetetus in the words: 

"It seems to me that one who knows something is perceiving 
the thing that he knows, and, so far as I can see at present, 
knowledge is nothing but perception." 

Socrates identifies this doctrine with that of Protagoras, that 
"man is the measure of all things," i.e. that any given thing "is 
to me such as it appears to me, and is to you such as it appears 
to you." Socrates adds: "Perception, then, is always something 
that _is_, and, as being knowledge, it is infallible." 

A large part of the argument that follows is concerned with the 
characterization of perception; when once this is completed, it 
does not take long to prove that such a thing as perception has 
turned out to be cannot be knowledge. 

Socrates adds to the doctrine of Protagoras the doctrine of
Heraclitus, that everything is always changing, i.e. that "all the
things we are pleased to say 'are' really are in process of becoming."
Plato believes this to be true of objects of sense, but not of the
objects of real knowledge. Throughout the dialogue, however, his
positive doctrines remain in the background.

From the doctrine of Heraclitus, even if it be only applicable 
to objects of sense, together with the definition of knowledge as 
perception, it follows that knowledge is of what becomes, not of 
what is. 

There are, at this point, some puzzles of a very elementary 
character. We are told that, since 6 is greater than 4 but less than 
12, 6 is both great and small, which is a contradiction. Again, 
Socrates is now taller than Theaetetus, who is a youth not yet 
full grown; but in a few years Socrates will be shorter than 
Theaetetus. Therefore Socrates is both tall and short. The idea 
of a relational proposition seems to have puzzled Plato, as it did 
most of the great philosophers down to Hegel (inclusive). These 
puzzles, however, are not very germane to the argument, and 
may be ignored. 

Returning to perception, it is regarded as due to an interaction 
between the object and the sense-organ, both of which, according 
to the doctrine of Heraclitus, are always changing, and both of 
which, in changing, change the percept. Socrates remarks that 
when he is well he finds wine sweet, but when ill, sour. Here it 
is a change in the percipient that causes the change in the percept. 

Certain objections to the doctrine of Protagoras are advanced, 
and some of these are subsequently withdrawn. It is urged that 
Protagoras ought equally to have admitted pigs and baboons as 
measures of all things, since they also are percipients. Questions 
are raised as to the validity of perception in dreams and in madness. 
It is suggested that, if Protagoras is right, one man knows no 
more than another: not only is Protagoras as wise as the gods, 
but, what is more serious, he is no wiser than a fool. Further, if 
one man's judgments are as correct as another's, the people who 
judge that Protagoras is mistaken have the same reason to be 
thought right as he has. 

Socrates undertakes to find an answer to many of these objections,
putting himself, for the moment, in the place of Protagoras. As for
dreams, the percepts are true as percepts. As for the argument about
pigs and baboons, this is dismissed as vulgar abuse. As for the
argument that, if each man is the measure of all things, one man is as
wise as another, Socrates suggests, on behalf of Protagoras, a very
interesting answer, namely that, while one judgment cannot be truer
than another, it can be better, in the sense of having better
consequences. This suggests pragmatism.[^63]

[^63]: It was presumably this passage that first suggested to F.C.S. Schiller his admiration of Protagoras. 

This answer, however, though Socrates has invented it, does 
not satisfy him. He urges, for example, that when a doctor foretells the course of my illness, he actually knows more of my future 
than I do. And when men differ as to what it is wise for the State 
to decree, the issue shows that some men had a greater knowledge 
as to the future than others had. Thus we cannot escape the 
conclusion that a wise man is a better measure of things than a fool. 

All these are objections to the doctrine that each man is the 
measure of all things, and only indirectly to the doctrine that 
"knowledge" means "perception," in so far as this doctrine leads 
to the other. There is, however, a direct argument, namely that 
memory must be allowed as well as perception. This is admitted, 
and to this extent the proposed definition is amended. 

We come next to criticisms of the doctrine of Heraclitus. This is
first pushed to extremes, in accordance, we are told, with the
practice of his disciples among the bright youths of Ephesus. A thing
may change in two ways, by locomotion, and by a change of quality, and
the doctrine of flux is held to state that everything is always
changing in both respects.[^64] And not only is everything always
undergoing some qualitative change, but everything is always changing
all its qualities so, we are told, clever people think at Ephesus.
This has awkward consequences. We cannot say "this is white," for if
it was white when we began speaking it will have ceased to be white
before we end our sentence. We cannot be right in saying we are seeing
a thing, for seeing is perpetually changing into not-seeing.[^65] If
everything is changing in every kind of way, seeing has no right to be
called seeing rather than not-seeing, or perception to be called
perception rather than not-perception. And when we say "perception is
knowledge," we might just as well say "perception is not-knowledge."

[^64]: It seems that neither Plato nor the dynamic youths of Ephesus had noticed that locomotion is impossible on the extreme Heraclitean doctrine. Motion demands that a given thing A should be now here, now there: it must remain the same thing while it moves. In the doctrine that Plato examines there is change of quality and change of place, but not change of substance. In this respect, modern quantum physics goes further than the most extreme disciples of Heraclitus went in Plato's time. Plato would have thought this fatal to science, but it has not proved so. 
[^65]: Compare the advertisement: "That's Shell, that was.

What the above argument amounts to is that, whatever else 
may be in perpetual flux, the meanings of words must be fixed, 
at least for a time, since otherwise no assertion is definite, and no 
assertion is true rather than false. There must be something more 
or less constant, if discourse and knowledge are to be possible. 
This, I think, should be admitted. But a great deal of flux is 
compatible with this admission. 

There is, at this point, a refusal to discuss Parmenides, on the
ground that he is too great and grand. He is a "reverend and awful
figure." "There was a sort of depth in him that was altogether noble."
He is "one being whom I respect above all." In these remarks Plato
shows his love for a static universe, and his dislike of the
Heraclitean flux which he has been admitting for the sake of argument.
But after this expression of reverence he abstains from developing the
Parmenidean alternative to Heraclitus. We now reach Plato's final
argument against the identification of knowledge with perception. He
begins by pointing out that we perceive through eyes and ears, rather
than with them, and he goes on to point out that some of our knowledge
is not connected with any sense-organ. We can know, for instance, that
sounds and colors are unlike, though no organ of sense can perceive
both. There is no special organ for "existence and non-existence,
likeness and unlikeness, sameness and differences, and also unity and
numbers in general." The same applies to honorable and dishonorable,
and good and bad. "The mind contemplates some things through its own
instrumentality, others through the bodily faculties." We perceive
hard and soft through touch, but it is the mind that judges that they
exist and that they are contraries. Only the mind can reach existence,
and we cannot reach truth if we do not reach existence. It follows
that we cannot know things through the senses alone, since through the
senses alone we cannot know that things exist. Therefore knowledge
consists in reflection, not in impressions, and perception is not
knowledge, because it "has no part in apprehending truth, since it has
none in apprehending existence."

To disentangle what can be accepted from what must be rejected 
in this argument against the identification of knowledge with 
perception is by no means easy. There are three inter-connected 
theses that Plato discusses, namely: 

 1. Knowledge is perception; 
 2. Man is the measure of all things; 
 3. Everything is in a state of flux. 

(1) The first of these, with which alone the argument is primarily
concerned, is hardly discussed on its own account except in the final
passage with which we have just been concerned. Here it is argued that
comparison, knowledge of existence, and understanding of number, are
essential to knowledge, but cannot be included in perception since
they are not effected through any sense-organ. The things to be said
about these are different. Let us begin with likeness and unlikeness.

That two shades of color, both of which I am seeing, are similar or
dissimilar as the case may be, is something which I, for my part,
should accept, not indeed as a "percept," but as a "judgment of
perception." A percept, I should say, is not knowledge, but merely
something that happens, and that belongs equally to the world of
physics and to the world of psychology. We naturally think of
perception, as Plato does, as a relation between a percipient and an
object: we say "I see a table." But here "I" and "table" are logical
constructions. The core of crude occurrence is merely certain patches
of color. These are associated with images of touch, they may cause
words, and they may become a source of memories. The percept as filled
out with images of touch becomes an "object," which is supposed
physical; the percept as filled out with words and memories becomes a
"perception," which is part of a "subject" and is considered mental.
The percept is just an occurrence, and neither true nor false; the
percept as filled out with words is a judgment, and capable of truth
or falsehood. This judgment I call a "judgment of perception." The
proposition "knowledge is perception" must be interpreted as meaning
"knowledge is judgments of perception." It is only in this form that
it is grammatically capable of being correct.

To return to likeness and unlikeness, it is quite possible, when I
perceive two colors simultaneously, for their likeness or unlikeness
to be part of the datum, and to be asserted in a judgment of
perception. Plato's argument that we have no sense-organ for
perceiving likeness and unlikeness ignores the cortex, and assumes
that all sense-organs must be at the surface of the body.

The argument for including likeness and unlikeness as possible
perceptive data is as follows. Let us assume that we see two shades of
color A and B, and that we judge "A is like B." Let us assume
further, as Plato does, that such a judgment is in general correct,
and, in particular, is correct in the case we are considering. There
is, then, a relation of likeness between A and B, and not merely a
judgment on our part asserting likeness. If there were only our
judgment, it would be an arbitrary judgment, incapable of truth or
falsehood. Since it obviously is capable of truth or falsehood, the
likeness can subsist between A and B, and cannot be merely something
"mental." The judgment "A is like B" is true (if it is true) in virtue
of a "fact," just as much as the judgment "A is red" or "A is round."
The mind is no wore involved in the perception of likeness than in the
perception of color.

I come now to _existence_ on which Plato lays great stress. We 
have, he says, as regards sound and color, a thought which 
includes both at once, namely that they exist. Existence belongs 
to everything, and is among the things that the mind apprehends 
by itself; without reaching existence, it is impossible to reach 
truth. 

The argument against Plato here is quite different from that 
in the case of likeness and unlikeness. The argument here is that 
all that Plato says about existence is bad grammar, or rather bad 
syntax. This point is important, not only in connection with 
Plato, but also with other matters such as the ontological argument 
for the existence of the Deity. 

Suppose you say to a child "lions exist, but unicorns don't," 
you can prove your point so far as lions are concerned by taking 
him to the Zoo and saying "look, that's a lion." You will not, 
unless you are a philosopher, add: "And you can see that that 
exists." If, being a philosopher, you do add this, you are uttering 
nonsense. To say "lions exist" means "there are lions," i.e. "'_x_ 
is a lion' is true for a suitable _x_." But we cannot say of the suitable 
_x_ that it "exists"; we can only apply this verb to a description, 
complete or incomplete. "Lion" is an incomplete description, 
because it applies to many objects: "The largest lion in the Zoo" 
is complete, because it applies to only one object. 

Now suppose that I am looking at a bright red patch. I may 
say "this is my present percept"; I may also say "my present 
percept exists"; but I must not say "this exists" because the 
word "exists" is only significant when applied to a description 
as opposed to a name.[^66] This disposes of _existence_ as one of the 
things that the mind is aware of in objects. 

[^66]: On this subject see the last chapter of the present work. 

I come now to understanding of numbers. Here there are two very
different things to be considered: on the one hand, the propositions
of arithmetic, and on the other hand, empirical propositions of
enumeration. "2 + 2 = 4" is of the former kind; "I have ten fingers"
is of the latter.

I should agree with Plato that arithmetic, and pure mathematics
generally, is not derived from perception. Pure mathematics consists
of tautologies, analogous to "men are men," but usually more
complicated. To know that a mathematical proposition is correct, we do
not have to study the world, but only the meanings of the symbols; and
the symbols, when we dispense with definitions (of which the purpose
is merely abbreviation), are found to be such words as "or" and "not,"
and "all" and "some," which do not, like "Socrates," denote anything
in the actual world. A mathematical equation asserts that two groups
of symbols have the same meaning; and so long as we confine ourselves
to pure mathematics, this meaning must be one that can be understood
without knowing anything about what can be perceived. Mathematical
truth, therefore, is, as Plato contends, independent of perception;
but it is truth of a very peculiar sort, and is concerned only with
symbols.

Propositions of enumeration, such as "I have ten fingers," are in
quite a different category, and are obviously, at least in part,
dependent on perception. Clearly the concept "finger" is abstracted
from perception; but how about the concept "ten"? Here we may seem to
have arrived at a true universal or Platonic idea. We cannot say that
"ten" is abstracted from perception, for any percept which can be
viewed as ten of some kind of thing can equally well be viewed
otherwise. Suppose I give the name "digitary" to all the fingers of
one hand taken together; then I can say "I have two digitaries," and
this describes the same fact of perception as I formerly described by
the help of the number ten. Thus in the statement "I have ten fingers"
perception plays a smaller part, and conception a larger part, than in
such a statement as "this is red." The matter, however, is only one of
degree.

The complete answer, as regards propositions in which the 
word "ten" occurs, is that, when these propositions are correctly 
analyzed, they are found to contain no constituent corresponding 
to the word "ten." To explain this in the case of such a large 
number as ten would be complicated; let us, therefore, substitute 
"I have two hands." This means: 

"There is an a such that there is a _b_ such that _a_ and _b_ are not 
identical and whatever _x_ may be, '_x_ is a hand of mine' is true 
when, and only when, _x_ is _a_ or _x_ is _b_." 

Here the word "two" does not occur. It is true that two letters 
a and b occur, but we do not need to know that they are two, any 
more than we need to know that they are black, or white, or 
whatever color they may happen to be. 

Thus numbers are, in a certain precise sense, formal. The facts which
verify various propositions asserting that various collections each
have two members, have in common, not a constituent, but a form. In
this they differ from propositions about the Statue of Liberty, or the
moon, or George Washington. Such propositions refer to a particular
portion of space-time; it is this that is in common between all the
statements that can be made about the Statue of Liberty. But there is
nothing in common among propositions "there are two so-and-so's"
except a common form. The relation of the symbol "two" to the meaning
of a proposition in which it occurs is far more complicated than the
relation of the symbol "red" to the meaning of a proposition in which
it occurs. We may say, in a certain sense, that the symbol "two" means
nothing, for, when it occurs in a true statement, there is no
corresponding constituent in the meaning of the statement. We may
continue, if we like, to say that numbers are eternal, immutable, and
so on, but we must add that they are logical fictions.

There is a further point. Concerning sound and color, Plato 
says "both together are _two_, and each of them is _one_." We have 
considered the _two_ now we must consider the _one_. There is here 
a mistake very analogous to that concerning existence. The predicate "one" is not applicable to things, but only to unit classes. 
We can say "the earth has one satellite," but it is a syntactical 
error to say "the moon is one." For what can such an assertion 
mean? You may just as well say "the moon is many" since it 
has many parts. To say "the earth has one satellite" is to give a 
property of the concept "earth's satellite," namely the following 
property: 

"There is a _c_ such that '_x_ is a satellite of the earth' is true when, 
and only when, _x_ is _c_" 

This is an astronomical truth; but if, for "a satellite of the 
earth" you substitute "the moon" or any other proper name, the 
result is either meaningless or a mere tautology. "One," therefore, 
is a property of certain concepts, just as "ten" is a property of the 
concept "my finger." But to argue "the earth has one satellite, 
namely the moon, therefore the moon is one" is as bad as to 
argue "The Apostles were twelve; Peter was an apostle; therefore 
Peter was twelve," which would be valid if for "twelve" we 
substituted "white." 

The above considerations have shown that, while there is a 
formal kind of knowledge, namely logic and mathematics, which 
is not derived from perception, Plato's arguments as regards all 
other knowledge are fallacious. This does not, of course, prove 
that his conclusion is false; it proves only that he has given no 
valid reason for supposing it true. 

(2) I come now to the position of Protagoras, that man is the 
measure of all things, or, as it is interpreted, that each man is the 
measure of all things. Mere it is essential to decide the level upon 
which the discussion is to proceed. It is obvious that, to begin 
with, we must distinguish between percepts and inferences. Among 
percepts, each man is inevitably confined to his own; what he 
knows of the percepts of others he knows by inference from his 
own percepts in hearing and reading. The percepts of dreamers 
and madmen, as percepts, arc just as good as those of others; the 
only objection to them is that, as their context is unusual, they 
are apt to give rise to fallacious inferences. 

But how about inferences? Are they equally personal and private? In a
sense, we must admit that they are. What I am to believe, 1 must
believe because of some reason that appeals to me. It is true that my
reason may be some one else's assertion, but that may be a perfectly
adequate reason for instance, if I am a judge listening to evidence.
And however Protagorean I may be, it is reasonable to accept the
opinion of an accountant about a set of figures in preference to my
own, for I may have repeatedly found that if, at first, I disagree
with him, a little more care shows me that he was right. In this sense
I may admit that another man is wiser than I am. The Protagorean
position, rightly interpreted, does not involve the view that I never
make mistakes, but only that the evidence of my mistakes must appear
to me. My past self can be judged just as another person can be
judged. But all this presupposes that, as regards inferences as
opposed to percepts, there is some impersonal standard of correctness.
If any inference that I happen to draw is just as good as any other,
then the intellectual anarchy that Plato deduces from Protagoras does
in fact follow. On this point, therefore, which is an important one,
Plato seems to be in the right. But the empiricist would say that
perceptions are the test of correctness in inference in empirical
material.

(3) The doctrine of universal flux is caricatured by Plato, and it is
difficult to suppose that any one ever held it in the extreme form
that he gives to it. Let us suppose, for example, that the colors we
see are continually changing. Such a word as "red" applies to many
shades of color, and if we say "I see red," there is no reason why
this should not remain true throughout the time that it takes to say
it. Plato gets his results by applying to processes of continuous
change such logical oppositions as perceiving and not-perceiving,
knowing and not-knowing. Such oppositions, however, are not suitable
for describing such processes. Suppose, on a foggy day, you watch a
man walking away from you along a road: he grows dimmer and dimmer,
and there comes a moment when you are sure that you no longer see him,
but there is an intermediate period of doubt. Logical oppositions have
been invented for our convenience, but continuous change requires a
quantitative apparatus, the possibility of which Plato ignores. What
he says on this subject, therefore, is largely beside the mark.

At the same time, it must be admitted that, unless words, to 
some extent, had fixed meanings, discourse would be impossible. 
Here again, however, it is easy to be too absolute. Words do change 
their meanings; take, for example, the word "idea," It is only 
by a considerable process of education that we learn to give to 
this word something like the meaning which Plato gave to it. It 
is necessary that the changes in the meanings of words should he 
slower than the changes that the words decribe; but it is not 
necessary that there should be no changes in the meanings of 
words. Perhaps this does not apply to the abstract words of logic 
and mathematics, but these words, as we have seen, apply only 
to the form, not to the matter, of propositions. Here, again, we 
find that logic and mathematics are peculiar. Plato, under the 
influence of the Pythagoreans, assimilated other knowledge too 
much to mathematics. He shared this mistake with many of the 
greatest philosophers, but it was a mistake none the less. 

## Chapter XIX ARISTOTLE'S METAPHYSICS 

In reading any important philosopher, but most of all in reading
Aristotle, it is necessary to study him in two ways: with reference to
his predecessors, and with reference to his successors. In the former
aspect, Aristotle's merits are enormous; in the latter, his demerits
are equally enormous. For his demerits, however, his successors are
more responsible than he is. He came at the end of the creative period
in Greek thought, and after his death it was two thousand years before
the world produced any philosopher who could be regarded as
approximately his equal. Towards the end of this long period his
authority had become almost as unquestioned as that of the Church, and
in science, as well as in philosophy, had become a serious obstacle to
progress. Ever since the beginning of the seventeenth century, almost
every serious intellectual advance has had to begin with an attack on
some Aristotelian doctrine; in logic, this is still true at the
present day. But it would have been at least as disastrous if any of
his predecessors (except perhaps Democritus) had acquired equal
authority. To do him justice, we must, to begin with, forget his
excessive posthumous fame, and the equally excessive posthumous
condemnation to which it led.

Aristotle was born, probably in 384 BC, at Stagira in Thrace. 
His father had inherited the position of family physician to the 
king of Macedonia. At about the age of eighteen Aristotle came 
to Athens and became a pupil of Plato; he remained in the Academy for nearly twenty years, until the death of Plato in 348-7 BC. 
He then travelled for a time, and married either the sister or the 
niece of a tyrant named Hermias. (Scandal said she was the 
daughter or concubine of Hermias, but both stories are disproved 
by the fact that he was a eunuch.) In 343 BC he became tutor to 
Alexander, then thirteen years old, and continued in that position 
until, at the age of sixteen, Alexander was pronounced by his 
father to be of age, and was appointed regent during Philip's 
absence. Everything one would wish to know of the relations of 
Aristotle and Alexander is unascertainable, the more so as legends 
were soon invented on the subject. There are letters between them 
which are generally regarded as forgeries. People who admire 
both men suppose that the tutor influenced the pupil. Hegel 
thinks that Alexander's career shows the practical usefulness of 
philosophy. As to this, A. W. Benn says: "It would be unfortunate 
if philosophy had no better testimonial to show for herself than 
the character of Alexander.... Arrogant, drunken, cruel, 
vindictive, and grossly superstitious, he united the vices of a 
Highland chieftain to the frenzy of an Oriental despot."[^67]

[^67]: _The Greek Philosophers_, Vol. I, p. 285. 

For my part, while I agree with Benn about the character of Alexander,
I nevertheless think that his work was enormously important and
enormously beneficial, since, but for him, the whole tradition of
Hellenic civilization might well have perished. As to Aristotle's
influence on him, we are left free to conjecture whatever seems to us
most plausible. For my part, I should suppose it nil. Alexander was an
ambitious and passionate boy, on bad terms with his father, and
presumably impatient of schooling. Aristotle thought no State should
have as many as one hundred thousand citizens,[^68] and preached the
doctrine of the golden mean. I cannot imagine his pupil regarding him
as anything but a prosy old pedant, set over him by his father to keep
him out of mischief. Alexander, it is true, had a certain snobbish
respect for Athenian civilization, but this was common to his whole
dynasty, who wished to prove that they were not barbarians. It was
analogous to the feeling of nineteenth-century Russian aristocrats for
Paris. This, therefore, was not attributable to Aristotle's influence.
And I do not see anything else in Alexander that could possibly have
come from this source.

[^68]: _Ethics_, 1170B. 


It is more surprising that Alexander had so little influence on
Aristotle, whose speculations on politics were blandly oblivious of
the fact that the era of City States had given way to the era of
empires. I suspect that Aristotle, to the end, thought of him as "that
idle and headstrong' boy, who never could understand anything of
philosophy." On the whole, the contacts of these two great men seem to
have been as unfruitful as if they had lived in different worlds.

From 335 BC to 323 BC (in which latter year Alexander died), Aristotle
lived at Athens. It was during these twelve years that he founded his
school and wrote most of his books. At the death of Alexander, the
Athenians rebelled, and turned on his friends, including Aristotle,
who was indicted for impiety, but, unlike Socrates, fled to avoid
punishment. In the next year (322) he died.

Aristotle, as a philosopher, is in many ways very different from all
his predecessors. He is the first to write like a professor: his
treatises are systematic, his discussions are divided into heads, he
is a professional teacher, not an inspired prophet. His work is
critical, careful, pedestrian, without any trace of Bacchic
enthusiasm. The Orphic elements in Plato are watered down in
Aristotle, and mixed with a strong dose of common sense; where he is
Platonic, one feels that his natural temperament has been overpowered
by the teaching to which he has been subjected. He is not passionate,
or in any profound sense religious. The errors of his predecessors
were the glorious errors of youth attempting the impossible; his
errors are those of age which cannot free itself of habitual
prejudices. He is best in detail and in criticism; he fails in large
construction, for lack of fundamental clarity and Titanic fire.

It is difficult to decide at what point to begin an account of
Aristotle's metaphysics, but perhaps the best place is his criticism
of the theory of ideas and his own alternative doctrine of universals.
He advances against the theory of ideas a number of very good
arguments, most of which are already to be found in Plato's
Parmenides. The strongest argument is that of the "third man": if a
man is a man because he resembles the ideal man, there must be a still
more ideal man to whom both ordinary men and the ideal man are
similar. Again, Socrates is both a man and an animal, and the question
arises whether the ideal man is an ideal animal; if he is, there must
be as many ideal animals as there are species of animals. It is
needless to pursue the matter; Aristotle makes it obvious that, when a
number of individuals share a predicate, this cannot be because of
relation to something of the same kind as themselves, but more ideal.
This much may be taken as proved, but Aristotle's own doctrine is far
from clear. It was this lack of clarity that made possible the
medieval controversy between nominalists and realists.

Aristotle's metaphysics, roughly speaking, may be described as Plato
diluted by common sense. He is difficult because Plato and common
sense do not mix easily. When one tries to understand him, one thinks
part of the time that he is expressing the ordinary views of a person
innocent of philosophy and the rest of the time that he is setting
forth Platonism with a new vocabulary. It does not do to lay too much
stress on any single passage, because there is liable to be a
correction or modification of it in some later passage. On the whole,
the easiest way to understand both his theory of universals and his
theory of matter and form is to set forth first the common-sense
doctrine which is half of his view, and then to consider the Platonic
modifications to which he subjects it.

Up to a certain point, the theory of universals is quite simple. In
language, there are proper names, and there are adjectives. The proper
names apply to "things" or "persons," each of which is the only thing
or person to which the name in question applies. The sun, the moon,
France, Napoleon, are unique; there are not a number of instances of
things to which these names apply. On the other hand, words like
"cat," "dog," "man" apply to many different things. The problem of
universals is concerned with the meanings of such words, and also of
adjectives, such as "white," "hard," "round," and so on. He says: "By
the term 'universal' I mean that which is of such a nature as to be
predicated of many subjects, by 'individual' that which is not thus
predicated."[^69]

[^69]: _On Interpretation_, 17. 

What is signified by a proper name is a "substance" while 
what is signified by an adjective or class-name, such as "human" 
or "man," is called a "universal." A substance is a "this," but a 
universal is a "such" it indicates the sort of thing, not the actual 
particular thing. A universal is not a substance, because it is not 
a "this." (Plato's heavenly bed would be a "this" to those who 
could perceive it; this is a matter as to which Aristotle disagrees 
with Plato.) "It seems impossible," Aristotle says, "that any universal term should be the name of a substance. For... the 
substance of each thing is that which is peculiar to it, which does 
not belong to anything else; but the universal is common, since 
that is called universal which is sUch as to belong to more than 
one thing." The gist of the matter, so far, is that a universal 
cannot exist by itself, but only in particular things. 

Superficially, Aristotle's doctrine is plain enough. Suppose I 
say "there is such a thing as the game of football," most people 
would regard the remark as a truism. But if I were to infer that 
football could exist without football-players, I should be rightly 
held to be talking nonsense. Similarly, it would be held, there is 
such a thing as parenthood, but only because there are parents; 
there is such a thing as sweetness, but only because there are 
sweet things; and there is redness, but only because there are 
red things. And this dependence is thought to be not reciprocal: 
the men who play football would still exist even if they never 
played football; things which are usually sweet may turn sour; 
and my face, which is usually red, may turn pale without ceasing 
to be my face. In this way we are led to conclude that what is 
meant by an adjective is dependent for its being on what is meant 
by a proper name, but not vice versa. This is, I think, what 
Aristotle means. His doctrine on this point, as on many others, 
is a common-sense prejudice pedantically expressed. 

But it is not easy to give precision to the theory. Granted that 
football could not exist without football-players, it could perfectly 
well exist without this or that football-player. And granted that a 
person can exist without playing football, he nevertheless cannot 
exist without doing something. The quality redness cannot exist 
without some subject, but it can exist without this or that subject; 
similarly a subject cannot exist without some quality, but can 
exist without this or that quality. The supposed ground for the 
distinction between things and qualities thus seems to be illusory. 

The true ground of the distinction is, in fact, linguistic; it is
derived from syntax. There are proper names, adjectives, and
relation-words; we may say "John is wise, James is foolish, John is
taller than James," Here "John" and "James" are proper names, "wise"
and "foolish" are adjectives, and "taller" is a relation-word.
Metaphysicians, ever since Aristotle, have interpreted these
syntactical differences metaphysically: John and James are substances,
wisdom and folly are universal. (Relation-words were ignored or
misinterpreted.) It may be that, given sufficient care, metaphysical
differences can be found that have some relation to these syntactical
differences, but, if so, it will be only by means of a long process,
involving, incidentally, the creation of an artificial philosophical
language. And this language will contain no such names as "John" and
"James" and no such adjectives as "wise" and "foolish"; all the words
of ordinary languages will have yielded to analysis, and been replaced
by words having a less complex significance. Until this labour has
been performed, the question of particulars and universals cannot be
adequately discussed. And when we reach the point at which we can at
last discuss it, we shall find that the question we are discussing is
quite different from what we supposed it to be at the outset.

If, therefore, I have failed to make Aristotle's theory of universals
clear, that is (I maintain) because it is not clear. But it is
certainly an advance on the theory of ideas, and is certainly
concerned with a genuine and very important problem.

There is another term which is important in Aristotle and in his
scholastic followers, and that is the term "essence." This is by no
means synonymous with "universal." Your "essence" is "what you are by
your very nature." It is, one may say, those of your properties which
you cannot lose without ceasing to be yourself. Not only an individual
thing, but a species, has an essence. The definition of a species
should consist in mentioning its essence. I shall return to the
conception of "essence" in connection with Aristotle's logic. For the
present I will merely observe that it seems to me a muddle-headed
notion, incapable of precision.

The next point in Aristotle's metaphysics is the distinction of 
"form" and "matter." (It must be understood that "matter," in 
the sense in which it is opposed to "form," is different from 
"matter" as opposed to "mind.") 

Here, again, there is a common-sense basis for Aristotle's theory, but
here, more than in the case of universals, the Platonic modifications
are very important. We may start with a marble statue; here marble is
the matter, while the shape conferred by the sculptor is the form. Or,
to take Aristotle's examples, if a man makes a bronze sphere, bronze
is the matter, and sphericity is the form; while in the case of a calm
sea, water is the matter and smoothness is the form. So far, all is
simple.

He goes on to say that it is in virtue of the form that the matter is
some one definite thing, and this is the substance of the thing. What
Aristotle means seems to be plain common sense: a "thing" must be
bounded, and the boundary constitutes its form. Take, say, a volume of
water: any part of it can be marked off from the rest by being
enclosed in a vessel, and then this part becomes a "thing," but so
long as the part is in no way marked out from the rest of the
homogeneous mass it is not a "thing." A statue is a "thing," and the
marble of which it is composed is, in a sense, unchanged from what it
was as part of a lump or as part of the provided it is so used that we
can translate our statements into a form in which the concept is
absent. "A block of marble is a potential statue" means "from a block
of marble, by suitable acts, a statue is produced." But when
potentiality is used as a fundamental and irreducible concept, it
always conceals confusion of thought. Aristotle's use of it is one of
the bad points in his system.

Aristotle's theology is interesting, and closely connected with 
the rest of his metaphysics indeed, "theology" is one of his 
names for what we call "metaphysics." (The book which we know 
under that name was not so called by him.) 

There are, he says, three kinds of substances: those that are sensible
and perishable, those that are sensible but not perishable, and those
that are neither sensible nor perishable. The first class includes
plants and animals, the second includes the heavenly bodies (which
Aristotle believed to undergo no change except motion), the third
includes the rational soul in man, and also God.

The main argument for God is the First Cause: there must be 
something which originates motion, and this something must itself 
be unmoved, and must be eternal, substance, and actuality. The 
object of desire and the object of thought, Aristotle says, cause 
movement in this way, without themselves being in motion. So 
God produces motion by being loved, whereas every other cause 
of motion works by being itself in motion (like a billiard ball). 
God is pure thought; for thought is what is best. "Life also belongs 
to God; for the actuality of thought is life, and God is that 
actuality; and God's self-dependent actuality is life most good 
and eternal. We say therefore that God is a living being, eternal, 
most good, so that life and duration continuous and eternal belong 
to God; for this is God" (1072). 

"It is clear then from what has been said that there is a substance
which is eternal and unmovable and separate from sensible things. It
has been shown that this substance cannot have any magnitude, but is
without parts and indivisible.... But it has also been shown that it
is impassive and unalterable; for all the other changes are posterior
to change of place" (1073).

God does not have the attributes of a Christian Providence, for 
it would derogate from His perfection to think about anything 
except what is perfect, i.e. Himself "It must be of itself that the 
divine thought thinks (since it is the most excellent of things), 
and its thinking is a thinking on thinking" (1074). We must infer 
that God does not know of the existence of our sublunary world. 
Aristotle, like Spinoza, holds that, while men must love God, 
it is impossible that God should love men. 

God is not definable as "the unmoved mover." On the contrary,
astronomical considerations lead to the conclusion that there are
either forty-seven or fifty-five unmoved movers (1074). The relation
of these to God is not made clear; indeed the natural interpretation
would be that there are forty-seven or fifty-five gods. For after one
of the above passages on God Aristotle proceeds: "We must not ignore
the question whether we are to suppose one such substance or more than
one," and at once embarks upon the argument that leads to the
forty-seven or fifty-five unmoved movers.

The conception of an unmoved mover is a difficult one. To a modern
mind, it would seem that the cause of a change must be a previous
change, and that, if the universe were ever wholly static, it would
remain so eternally. To understand what Aristotle means, we must take
account of what he says about causes. There are, according to him,
four kinds of causes, which were called, respectively, material,
formal, efficient, and final. Let us take again the man who is making
a statue. The material cause of the statue is the marble, the formal
cause is the essence of the statue to be produced, the efficient cause
is the contact of the chisel with the marble, and the final cause is
the end that the sculptor has in view. In modern terminology, the word
"cause" would be confined to the efficient cause. The unmoved mover
may be regarded as a final cause: it supplies a purpose for change,
which is essentially an evolution towards likeness with God.

I said that Aristotle was not by temperament deeply religious, 
but this is only partly true. One could, perhaps, interpret one 
aspect of his religion, somewhat freely, as follows: 

God exists eternally, as pure thought, happiness, complete
self-fulfilment, without any unrealized purposes. The sensible world,
on the contrary, is imperfect, but it has life, desire, thought of an
imperfect kind, and aspiration. All living things are in a greater or
less degree aware of God, and are moved to action by admiration and
love of God. Thus God is the final cause of all activity. Change
consists in giving form to matter, but, where sensible things are
concerned, a substratum of matter always remains. Only God consists of
form without matter. The world is continually evolving towards a
greater degree of form, and thus becoming progressively more like God.
But the process cannot be completed, because matter cannot be wholly
eliminated. This is a religion of progress and evolution, for God's
static perfection moves the world only through the love that finite
beings feel for Him. Plato was mathematical, Aristotle was biological;
this accounts for the differences in their religions.

This would, however, be a one-sided view of Aristotle's religion; 
he has also the Greek love of static perfection and preference for 
contemplation rather than action. His doctrine of the soul 
illustrates this aspect of his philosophy. 

Whether Aristotle taught immortality in any form, or not, was a vexed
question among commentators. Avertoes, who held that he did not, had
followers in Christian countries, of whom the more extreme were called
Epicureans, and whom Dante found in hell. In fact, Aristotle's
doctrine is complex, and easily lends itself to misunderstandings. In
his book _On the Soul_, he regards the soul as bound up with the body,
and ridicules the Pythagorean doctrine of transmigration (407). The
soul, it seems, perishes with the body: "it indubitably follows that
the soul is inseparable from its body" (413); but he immediately adds:
"or at any rate certain parts of it are." Body and soul are related as
matter and form: "the soul must be a substance in the sense of the
form of a material body having life potentially within it. But
substance is actuality, and thus soul is the actuality of a body as
above characterized" (412). Soul "is substance in the sense which
corresponds to the definitive formula of a thing's essence. That means
that it is the 'essential whatness' of a body of the character just
assigned" (i.e. having life) (412). The soul is the first grade of
actuality of a natural body having life potentially in it. The body so
described is a body which is organized (412). To ask whether soul and
body are one is as meaningless as to ask whether the wax and the shape
given it by the stamp are one (412). Self nutrition is the only
psychic power possessed by plants (413). The soul is the final cause
of the body (414).

In this book, he distinguishes between "soul" and "mind," making mind
higher than soul, and less bound to the body. After peaking of the
relation of soul and body, he says: "The case of mind is different; it
seems to be an independent substance implanted within the soul and to
be incapable of being destroyed" (408). Again: "We have no evidence as
yet about mind or the power to think; it seems to be a widely
different kind of soul, differing as what is eternal from what is
perishable; it alone is capable of existence in isolation from all
other psychic powers. All the other parts of soul, it is evident from
what we have said, are, in spite of certain statements to the
contrary, incapable of separate existence" (413). The mind is the part
of us that understands mathematics and philosophy; its objects are
timeless, and therefore it is regarded as itself timeless. The soul is
what moves the body and perceives sensible objects; it is
characterized by self-nutrition, sensation, feeling, and motivity
(413); but the mind has the higher function of thinking, which has no
relation to the body or to the senses. Hence the mind can be immortal,
though the rest of the soul cannot.

To understand Aristotle's doctrine of the soul, we must remember that
the soul is the "form" of the body, and that spatial shape is one kind
of "form." What is there in common between soul and shape? I think
what is in common is the conferring of unity upon a certain amount of
matter. The part of a block of marble which afterwards becomes a
statue is, as yet, not separated from the rest of the marble; it is
not yet a "thing," and has not yet any unity. After the sculptor has
made the statue, it has unity, which it derives from its shape. Now
the essential feature of the soul, in virtue of which it is the "form"
of the body, is that it makes the body an organic whole, having
purposes as a unit. A single organ has purposes lying outside itself;
the eye, in isolation, cannot see. Thus many things can be said in
which an animal or plant as a whole is the subject, which cannot be
said about any part of it. It is in this sense that organization, or
form, confers substantiality. That which confers substantiality upon a
plant or animal is what Aristotle calls its "soul." But "mind" is
something different, less intimately bound up with the body; perhaps
it is a part of the soul, but it is possessed by only a small minority
of living beings (415). Mind as speculation cannot be the cause of
movement, for it never thinks about what is practicable, and never
says what is to be avoided or what pursued (432).

A similar doctrine, though with a slight change of terminology, is set
forth in the _Nicomachean Ethics_. There is in the soul one element
that is rational, and one that is irrational. The irrational part is
two-fold: the vegetative, which is found in everything living, even in
plants, and the appetitive, which exists in all animals (1102). The
life of the rational soul consists in contemplation, which is the
complete happiness of man though not fully attainable. "Such a life
would be too high for man; for it is not in so far as he is man that
he will live so, but in so far as something divine is present in him;
and by so much as this is superior to our composite nature is its
activity superior to that which is the exercise of the other kind of
virtue (the practical kind). If reason is divine, then, in comparison
with man, the life in accordance with it is divine in comparison with
human life. But we must not follow those who advise us, being men, to
think of human things, and being mortal, of mortal things, but must,
so far as we can, make ourselves immortal, and strain every nerve to
live in accordance with the best thing in us; for even if it be small
in bulk, much more does it in power and worth surpass everything"
(1177). It seems, from these passages, that individuality what
distinguishes one man from another is connected with the body and the
irrational soul, while the rational soul or mind is divine and
impersonal. One man likes oysters, and another likes pineapples; this
distinguishes between them. But when they think about the
multiplication table, provided they think correctly, there is no
difference between them. The irrational separates us, the rational
unites us. Thus the immortality of mind or reason is not a personal
immortality of separate men, but a share in God's immortality. It does
not appear that Aristotle believed in personal immortality, in the
sense in which it was taught by Plato and afterwards by Christianity.
He believed only that, in so far as men are rational, they partake of
the divine, which is immortal. It is open to man to increase the
element of the divine in his nature, and to do so is the highest
virtue. But if he succeeded completely, he would have ceased to exist
as a separate person. This is perhaps not the only possible
interpretation of Aristotle's words, but I think it is the most
natural.

## Chapter XX ARISTOTLE'S ETHICS 

In the corpus of Aristotle's works, three treatises on ethics have a
place, but two of these are now generally held to be by disciples. The
third, the _Nicomachean Ethics_, remains for the most part unquestioned
as to authenticity, but even in this book there is a portion (Books V,
VI, and VII) which is held by many to have been incorporated from one
of the works of disciples. I shall, however, ignore this controversial
question, and treat the book as a whole and as Aristotle's.

The views of Aristotle on ethics represent, in the main, the
prevailing opinions of educated and experienced men of his day.  They
are not, like Plato's, impregnated with mystical religion; nor do they
countenance such unorthodox theories as are to be found in the
_Republic_ concerning property and the family. Those who neither fall
below nor rise above the level of decent, well-behaved citizens will
find in the _Ethics_ a systematic account of the principles by which
they hold that their conduct should be regulated.  Those who demand
anything more will be disappointed. The book appeals to the
respectable middle-aged, and has been used by them, especially since
the seventeenth century, to repress the ardors and enthusiasms of the
young. But to a man with any depth of feeling it is likely to be
repulsive.

The good, we are told, is _happiness_, which is an activity of the
soul. Aristotle says that Plato was right in dividing the soul into
two parts, one rational, the other irrational. The irrational part
itself he divides into the vegetative (which is found even in plants)
and the appetitive (which is found in all animals). The appetitive
part may be in some degree rational, when the goods that it seeks arc
such as reason approves of. This is essential to the account of
virtue, for reason alone, in Aristotle, is purely contemplative, and
docs not, without the help of appetite, lead to any practical
activity.

There are two kinds of virtues, _intellectual_ and _moral_,
corresponding to the two parts of the soul. Intellectual virtues
result from teaching, moral virtues from habit. It is the business of
the legislator to make the citizens good by forming good habits. We
become just by performing just acts, and similarly as regards other
virtues. By being compelled to acquire good habits, we shall in time,
Aristotle thinks, come to find pleasure in performing good
actions. One is reminded of Hamlet's speech to his mother:

> Assume a virtue if you have it not.  
> That monster, custom, who all sense doth eat,  
> Of habits devil, is angel, yet in this  
> That to the use of actions fair and good  
> He likewise gives a frock or livery  
> That aptly is put on.  

We now come to the famous doctrine of the golden mean.  Every virtue
is a mean between two extremes, each of which is a vice. This is
proved by an examination of the various virtues.  Courage is a mean
between cowardice and rashness; liberality, between prodigality and
meanness; proper pride, between vanity and humility; ready wit,
between buffoonery and boorishness; modesty, between bashfulness and
shamelessness. Some virtues do not seem to fit into this scheme; for
instance, truthfulness.  Aristotle says that this is a mean between
boastfulness and mock-modesty (1108), but this only applies to
truthfulness about oneself. I do not see how truthfulness in any wider
sense can be fitted into the scheme. There was once a mayor who had
adopted Aristotle's doctrine; at the end of his term of office he made
a speech saying that he had endeavored to steer the narrow line
between partiality on the one hand and impartiality on the other.  The
view of truthfulness as a mean seems scarcely less absurd.

Aristotle's opinions on moral questions are always such as were 
conventional in his day. On some points they differ from those of 
our time, chiefly where some form of aristocracy comes in. We 
think that human beings, at least in ethical theory, all have equal 
rights, and that justice involves equality; Aristotle thinks that 
justice involves, not equality, but right proportion, which is only 
sometimes equality (1131). 

The justice of a master or a father is a different thing from that 
of a citizen, for a son or slave is property, and there can be no 
injustice to one's own property (1134). As regards slaves, however, 
there is a slight modification of this doctrine in connection with 
the question whether it is possible for a man to be a friend of his 
slave: "There is nothing in common between the two parties; the 
slave is a living tool.... Qua slave, then, one cannot be friends 
with him. But qua man one can; for there seems to be some justice 
between any man and any other who can share in a system of 
law or be a party to an agreement; therefore there can also be 
friendship with him in so far as he is a man" (1161). 

A father can repudiate his son if he is wicked, but a son cannot
repudiate his father, because he owes him more than he can possibly
repay, especially existence (1163). In unequal relations, it is right,
since everybody should be loved in proportion to his worth, that the
inferior should love the superior more than the superior loves the
inferior: wives, children, subjects, should have more love for
husbands, parents, and monarchs than the latter have for them. In a
good marriage, "the man rules in accordance with his worth, and in
those matters in which a man should rule, but the matters that befit a
woman he hands over to her" (1160).  He should not rule in her
province; still less should she rule in his, as sometimes happens when
she is an heiress.

The best individual, as conceived by Aristotle, is a very different 
person from the Christian saint. He should have proper pride, and 
not underestimate his own merits. He should despise whoever 
deserves to be despised (1124). The description of the proud or 
magnanimous man[^70] is very interesting as showing the difference 
between pagan and Christian ethics, and the sense in which 
Nietzsche was justified in regarding Christianity as a slave-morality. 

[^70]: The Greek word means, literally, "great-souled," and is usually translated "magnanimous," but the Oxford translation renders it "proud." Neither word, in its modern usage, quite expresses Aristotle's meaning, but I prefer "magnanimous," and have therefore substituted it for "proud" in the above quotation from the Oxford translation.

One shudders to think what a vain man would be like. 
Whatever may be thought of the magnanimous man, one thing 
is clear: there cannot be very many of him in a community. I do 
not mean merely in the general sense in which there are not likely 
to be many virtuous men, on the ground that virtue is difficult; 
what I mean is that the virtues of the magnanimous man largely 
depend upon his having an exceptional social position. Aristotle 
considers ethics a branch of politics, and it is not surprising, after 
his praise of pride, to find that he considers monarchy the best 
form of government, and aristocracy the next best. Monarchs and 
aristocrats can be "magnanimous," but ordinary citizens would 
be laughable if they attempted to live up to such a pattern. 

This brings up a question which is half ethical, half political. 
Can we regard as morally satisfactory a community which, by its 
essential constitution, confines the best things to a few, and 
requires the majority to be content with the second-best? Plato 
and Aristotle say yes, and Nietzsche agrees with them. Stoics, 
Christians, and democrats say no. But there are great differences 
in their ways of saying no. Stoics and early Christians consider 
that the greatest good is virtue, and that external circumstances 
cannot prevent a man from being virtuous; there is therefore no 
need to seek a just social system, since social injustice affects only 
unimportant matters. The democrat, on the contrary, usually 
holds that, at least so far as politics are concerned, the most 
important goods are power and property; he cannot, therefore, 
acquiesce in a social system which is unjust in these respects. 

The Stoic-Christian view requires a conception of virtue very
different from Aristotle's, since it must hold that virtue is as
possible for the slave as for his master. Christian ethics disapproves
of pride, which Aristotle thinks a virtue, and praises humility, which
he thinks a vice. The intellectual virtues, which Plato and Aristotle
value above all others, have to be thrust out of the list altogether,
in order that the poor and humble may be able to be as virtuous as any
one else. Pope Gregory the Great solemnly reproved a bishop for
teaching grammar.

The Aristotelian view, that the highest virtue is for the few, is
logically connected with the subordination of ethics to politics, if
the aim is the good community rather than the good individual, it is
possible that the good community may be one in which there is
subordination. In an orchestra, the first violin is more important
than the oboe, though both arc necessary for the excellence of the
whole. It is impossible to organize an orchestra on the principle of
giving to each man what would be best for him as an isolated
individual. The same sort of thing applies to the government of a
large modern State, however democratic. A modern democracy unlike
those of antiquity confers great power upon certain chosen
individuals, Presidents or Prime Ministers, and must expect of them
kinds of merit which are not expected of the ordinary citizen. When
people are not thinking in terms of religion or political controversy,
they are likely to hold that a good President is more to be honored
than a good bricklayer. In a democracy a President is not expected to
be quite like Aristotle's magnanimous man, but still he is expected to
be rather different from the average citizen, and to have certain
merits connected with his station. These peculiar merits would perhaps
not be considered "ethical," but that is because we use this adjective
in a narrower sense than that in which it is used by Aristotle.

As a result of Christian dogma, the distinction between moral 
and other merits has become much sharper than it was in Greek 
times. It is a merit in a man to be a great poet or composer or 
painter, but not a moral merit; we do not consider him the more 
virtuous for possessing such aptitudes, or the more likely to go 
to heaven. Moral merit is concerned solely with acts of will, i.e. 
with choosing rightly among possible courses of action.[^71] I am not 
to blame for not composing an opera, because I don't know how 
to do it. The orthodox view is that, wherever two courses of action 
are possible, conscience tells me which is right, and to choose the 
other is sin. Virtue consists mainly in the avoidance of sin, rather 
than in anything positive. There is no reason to expect an educated 
man to be morally better than an uneducated man, or a clever 
man than a stupid man. In this way, a number of merits of great 
social importance are shut out from the realm of ethics. The 
adjective "unethical," in modern usage, has a much narrower 
range than the adjective "undesirable." It is undesirable to be 
feeble-minded, but not unethical. 

[^71]: It is true that Aristotle also says this (1105), but as he means it the consequences are not so far-reaching as in the Christian interpretation. 

Many modern philosophers, however, have not accepted this 
view of ethics. They have thought that one should first define the 
good, and then say that our actions ought to be such as tend to 
realize the good. This point of view is more like that of Aristotle, 
who holds that happiness is the good. The highest happiness, it 
is true, is only open to the philosopher, but to Aristotle that is no 
objection to the theory. 

Ethical theories may be divided into two classes, according as they
regard virtue as an end or a means. Aristotle, on the whole, takes the
view that virtues are means to an end, namely happiness. "The end,
then, being what we wish for, the means what we deliberate about and
choose, actions concerning means must be according to choice and
voluntary. Now the exercise of the virtues is concerned with means"
(1113). But there is another sense of virtue in which it is included in
the ends of action: "Human good is activity of soul in accordance with
virtue in a complete life" (1098). I think he would say that the
intellectual virtues are ends, but the practical virtues are only
means. Christian moralists hold that, while the consequences of
virtuous actions are in general good, they are not as good as the
virtuous actions themselves, which are to be valued on their own
account, and not on account of their effects. On the other hand, those
who consider pleasure the good regard virtues solely as means. Any
other definition of the good, except the definition as virtue, will
have the same consequence, that virtues are means to goods other than
themselves. On this question, Aristotle, as already said, agrees
mainly, though not wholly, with those who think the first business of
ethics is to define the good, and that virtue is to be defined as
action tending to produce the good.

The relation of ethics to politics raises another ethical question of
considerable importance. Granted that the good at which right action
should aim is the good of the whole community, or, ultimately, of the
whole human race, is this social good a sum of goods enjoyed by
individuals, or is it something belonging essentially to the whole,
not to the parts? We may illustrate the problem by the analogy of the
human body. Pleasures are largely associated with different parts of
the body, but we consider them as belonging to a person as a whole; we
may enjoy a pleasant smell, but we know that the nose alone could not
enjoy it. Some contend that, in a closely organized community, there
are, analogously, excellences belonging to the whole, but not to any
part. If they are metaphysicians, they may hold, like Hegel, that
whatever quality is good is an attribute of the universe as a whole;
but they will generally add that it is less mistaken to attribute good
to a State thap to an individual. Logically, the view may be put as
follows. We can attribute to a State various predicates that cannot be
attributed to its separate members that it is populous, extensive,
powerful, etc. The view we are considering puts ethical predicates in
this class, and says that they only derivatively belong to
individuals. A man may belong to a populous State, or to a good State;
but he, they say, is no more good than he is populous. This view,
which has been widely held by German philosophers, is not Aristotle's,
except possibly, in some degree, in his conception of justice.

A considerable part of the _Ethics_ is occupied with the discussion of
friendship, including all relations that involve affection. Perfect
friendship is only possible between the good, and it is impossible to
be friends with many people. One should not be friends with a person
of higher station than one's own, unless he is also of higher virtue,
which will justify the respect shown to him. We have seen that, in
unequal relations, such as those of man and wife or father and son,
the superior should be the more loved. It is impossible to be friends
with God, because He cannot love us. Aristotle discusses whether a man
can be a friend to himself, and decides that this is only possible if
he is a good man; wicked men, he asserts, often hate themselves. The
good man should love himself, but nobly (1169). Friends are a comfort
in misfortune, but one should not make them unhappy by seeking their
sympathy, as is done by women and womanish men (1171). It is not only
in misfortune that friends are desirable, for the happy man needs
friends with whom to share his happiness. "No one would choose the
whole world on condition of being alone, since man is a political
creature and one whose nature is to live with others" (1169). All that
is said about friendship is sensible, but there is not a word that
rises above common sense.

Aristotle again shows his good sense in the discussion of pleasure,
which Plato had regarded somewhat ascetically. Pleasure, as Aristotle
uses the word, is distinct from happiness, though there can be no
happiness without pleasure. There are, he says, three views of
pleasure: (1) that it is never good; (2) that some pleasure is good,
but most is bad; (3) that pleasure is good, but not the best. He
rejects the first of these on the ground that pain is certainly bad,
and therefore pleasure must be good. He says, very justly, that it is
nonsense to say a man can be happy on the rack: some degree of
external good fortune is necessary for happiness. He also disposes of
the view that all pleasures are bodily; all things have something
divine, and therefore some capacity for higher pleasures. Good men
have pleasure unless they are unfortunate, and God always enjoys a
single and simple pleasure (1152-1154).

There is another discussion of pleasure, in a later part of the 
book, which is not wholly consistent with the above. Here it is 
argued that there are bad pleasures, which, however, are not 
pleasures to poor people (1173); that perhaps pleasures differ in 
kind (ibid.); and that pleasures are good or bad according as they 
are connected with good or bad activities (1175). There are things 
that are valued more than pleasure; no one would be content to 
go through life with a child's intellect, even if it were pleasant to 
do so. Each animal has its proper pleasure, and the proper pleasure 
of man is connected with reason. 

This leads on to the only doctrine in the book which is not mere 
common sense. Happiness lies in virtuous activity, and perfect 
happiness lies in the best activity, which is contemplative. Contemplation is preferable to war or politics or any other practical 
career, because it allows leisure, and leisure is essential to happiness. Practical virtue brings only a secondary kind of happiness; 
the supreme happiness is in the exercise of reason, for reason, 
more than anything else, is man. Man cannot be wholly contemplative, but in so far as he is so he shares in the divine life. "The 
activity of God, which surpasses all others in blessedness, must 
be contemplative." Of all human beings, the philosopher is the 
most godlike in his activity, and therefore the happiest and best: 

> He who exercises his reason and cultivates it seems to be both in
> the best state of mind and most dear to the gods. For if the gods
> have any care for human affairs, as they are thought to have, it
> would be reasonable both that they should delight in that which was
> best and most akin to them (i.e. reason) and that they should reward
> those who love and honor this most, as caring for the things that
> are dear to them and acting both rightly and nobly. And that all
> these attributes belong most of all to the philosopher is manifest.
> He, therefore, is the dearest to the gods. And he who is that will
> presumably be also the happiest; so that in this way too the
> philosopher will more than any other be happy (1179).

This passage is virtually the peroration of the _Ethics_, the few 
paragraphs that follow are concerned with the transition to politics. 

Let us now try to decide what we are to think of the merits and 
demerits of the _Ethics_. Unlike many other subjects treated by 
Greek philosophers, ethics has not made any definite advances, 
in the sense of ascertained discoveries; nothing in ethics is known 
in a scientific sense. There is therefore no reason why an ancient 
treatise on it should be in any respect inferior to a modern one. 
When Aristotle talks about astronomy, we can say definitely that 
he is wrong; but when he talks about ethics we cannot say, in 
the same sense, either that he is wrong or that he is right. Broadly 
speaking, there are three questions that we can ask about the 
ethics of Aristotle, or of any other philosopher: (1) Is it internally 
self-consistent? (2) Is it consistent with the remainder of the 
author's views? (3) Does it give answers to ethical problems that 
are consonant to our own ethical feelings? If the answer to either 
the first or second question is in the negative, the philosopher in 
question has been guilty of some intellectual error. But if the 
answer to the third question is in the negative, we have no right 
to say that he is mistaken; we have only the right to say that we 
do not like him. 

Let us examine these three questions in turn, as regards the 
ethical theory set forth in the _Nicomachean Ethics_. 

(1) On the whole, the book is self-consistent, except in a few not
very important respects. The doctrine that the good is happiness, and
that happiness consists in successful activity, is well worked out.
The doctrine that every virtue is a mean between two extremes, though
very ingeniously developed, is less successful, since it does not
apply to intellectual contemplation, which, we are told, is the best
of all activities. It can, however, be maintained that the doctrine of
the mean is only intended to apply to the practical virtues, not to,
those of the intellect. Perhaps, to take another point, the position
of the legislator is somewhat ambiguous. He is to cause children and
young people to acquire the habit of performing good actions, which
will, in the end, lead them to find pleasure in virtue, and to act
virtuously without the need of legal compulsion. It is obvious that
the legislator might equally well cause the young to acquire bad
habits; if this is to be avoided, he must have all the wisdom of a
Platonic guardian; and if it is not avoided, the argument that a
virtuous life is pleasant will fail. This problem, however, belongs
perhaps more to politics than to ethics.

(2) Aristotle's ethics is, at all points, consistent with his
metaphysics. Indeed, his metaphysical theories are themselves the
expression of an ethical optimism. He believes in the scientific
importance of final causes, and this implies the belief that purpose
governs the course of development in the universe. He thinks that
changes are, in the main, such as embody an increase of organization
or "form," and at bottom virtuous actions are those that favor this
tendency. It is true that a great deal of his practical ethics is not
particularly philosophical, but merely the result of observation of
human affairs; but this part of his doctrine, though it may be
independent of his metaphysics, is not inconsistent with it.

(3) When we come to compare Aristotle's ethical tastes with our own,
we find, in the first place, as already noted, an acceptance of
inequality which is repugnant to much modern sentiment. Not only is
there no objection to slavery, or to the superiority of husbands and
fathers over wives and children, but it is held that what is best is
essentially only for the few magnanimous men and philosophers. Most
men, it would seem to follow, are mainly means for the production of a
few rulers and sages. Kant maintained that every human being is an end
in himself, and this may be taken as an expression of the view
introduced by Christianity. There is, however, a logical difficulty
in Kant's view, since it gives no means of reaching a decision when
two men's interests clash. If each is an end in himself, how are we to
arrive at a principle for determining which shall give way? Such a
principle must have to do with the community rather than with the
individual. In the broadest sense of the word, it will have to be a
principle of "justice." Bentham and the utilitarians interpret
"justice" as "equality": when two men's interests clash, the right
course is that which produces the greatest total of happiness,
regardless of which of the two enjoys it, or how it is shared among
them. If more is given to the better man than to the worse, that is
because, in the long run, the general happiness is increased by
rewarding virtue and punishing vice, not because of an ultimate
ethical doctrine that the good deserve more than the bad. "Justice,"
in this view, consists in considering only the amount of happiness
involved, without favor to one individual or class as against
another. Greek philosophers, including Plato and Aristotle, had a
different conception of justice, and it is one which is still widely
prevalent. They thought originally on grounds derived from religion
that each thing or person had its or his proper sphere, to overstep
which is "unjust." Some men, in virtue of their character and
aptitudes, have a wider sphere than others, and there is no injustice
if they enjoy a greater share of happiness. This view is taken for
granted in Aristotle, but its basis in primitive religion, which is
evident in the earliest philosophers, is no longer apparent in his
writings.

There is in Aristotle an almost complete absence of what may be called
benevolence or philanthropy. The sufferings of mankind, in so far as
he is aware of them do not move him emotionally; he holds them,
intellectually, to be an evil, but there is no evidence that they
cause him unhappiness except when the sufferers happen to be his
friends.

More generally, there is an emotional poverty in the _Ethics_, which is
not found in the earlier philosophers. There is something unduly smug
and comfortable about Aristotle's speculations on human affairs;
everything that makes men feel a passionate interest in each other
seems to be forgotten. Even his account of friendship is tepid. He
shows no sign of having had any of those experiences which make it
difficult to preserve sanity; all the more profound aspects of the
moral life are apparently unknown to him. He leaves out, one may say,
the whole sphere of human experience with which religion is concerned.
What he has to say is what will be useful to comfortable men of weak
passions; but he has nothing to say to those who are possessed by a
god or a devil, or whom outward misfortune drives to despair. For
these reasons, in my judgment, his _Ethics_, in spite of its fame, is
lacking in intrinsic importance.



## Chapter XXI ARISTOTLE'S POLITICS 

Aristotle's _Politics_ is both interesting and
important---interesting, as showing the common prejudices of educated
Greeks in his time, and important as a source of many principles which
remained influential until the end of the Middle Ages. I do not think
there is much in it that could be of any practical use to a statesman
of the present day, but there is a great deal that throws light on the
conflicts of parties in different parts of the Hellenic world. There
is not very much awareness of methods of government in non-Hellenic
States. There are, it is true, allusions to Egypt, Babylon, Persia,
and Carthage, but except in the case of Carthage they are somewhat
perfunctory. There is no mention of Alexander, and not even the
faintest awareness of the complete transformation that he was
effecting in the world. The whole discussion is concerned with City
States, and there is no prevision of their obsolescence. Greece, owing
to its division into independent cities, was a laboratory of political
experiment; but nothing to which these experiments were relevant
existed from Aristotle's time until the rise of the Italian cities in
the Middle Ages. In many ways, the experience to which Aristotle
appeals is more relevant to the comparatively modern world than to any
that existed for fifteen hundred years after the book was written.

There are many pleasant incidental remarks, some of which may be noted
before we embark upon political theory. We are told that Euripides,
when he was staying at the court of Archelaus, King of Macedon, was
accused of halitosis by a certain Decamnichus. To soothe his fury, the
king gave him permission to scourge Decamnichus, which he did.
Decamnichus, after waiting many years, joined in a successful plot to
kill the king; but by this time Euripides was dead. We are told that
children should be conceived in winter, when the wind is in the north;
that there must be a careful avoidance of indecency, because "shameful
words lead to shameful acts," and that obscenity is never to be
tolerated except in temples, where the law permits even ribaldry.
People should not marry too young, because, if they do, the children
will be weak and female, the wives will become wanton, and the
husbands stunted in their growth. The right age for marriage is
thirty-seven in men, eighteen in women.

We learn how Thales, being taunted with his poverty, bought up all the
olive-presses on the installment plan, and was then able to charge
monopoly rates for their use. This he did to show that philosophers
can make money, and, if they remain poor, it is because they have
something more important than wealth to think about. All this,
however, is by the way; it is time to come to more serious matters.

The book begins by pointing out the importance of the State; it is the
highest kind of community, and aims at the highest good. In order of
time, the family comes first; it is built on the two fundamental
relations of man and woman, master and slave, both of which are
natural. Several families combined make a village; several villages, a
State, provided the combination is nearly large enough to be
self-sufficing. The State, though later in time than the family, is
prior to it, and even to the individual, by nature; for "what each
thing is when fully developed we call its nature" and human society,
fully developed, is a State, and the whole is prior to the part. The
conception involved here is that of organism: a hand, when the body is
destroyed, is, we are told, no longer a hand. The implication is that
a hand is to be defined by its purpose that of grasping which it can
only perform when joined to a living body. In like manner an
individual cannot fulfill his purpose unless he is part of a State. He
who founded the State, Aristotle says, was the greatest of
benefactors; for without law man is the worst of animals, and law
depends for its existence on the State. The State is not a mere
society for exchange and the prevention of crime: "The end of the
State is the good life.... And the State is the union of families and
villages in a perfect and self-sufficing life, by which we mean a
happy and honorable life" (1280). "A political society exists for the
sake of noble actions, not of mere companionship" (1281).

A State being composed of households, each of which consists 
of one family, the discussion of politics should begin with the 
family. The bulk of this discussion is concerned with slavery 
for in antiquity the slaves were always reckoned as pan of the 
family. Slavery is expedient and right, but the slave should be 
naturally inferior to the master. From birth, some are marked out 
for subjection, others for rule; the man who is by nature not his 
own but another man's is by nature a slave. Slaves should not be 
Greeks, but of an inferior race with less spirit (1255 and 1330). 
Tame animals are better off when ruled by man, and so are those 
who are naturally inferior when ruled by their superiors. It may 
be questioned whether the practice of making slaves out of 
prisoners of war is justified; power, such as leads to victory in 
war, seems to imply superior virtue, but this is not always the 
case. War, however, is just when waged against men who, though 
intended by nature to be governed, will not submit (1256); and 
in this case, it is implied, it would be right to make slaves of the 
conquered. This would seem enough to justify any conqueror who 
ever lived; for no nation will admit that it is intended by nature to 
be governed, and the only evidence as to nature's intentions 
must be derived from the outcome of war. In every war, therefore, 
the victors are in the right and the vanquished in the wrong. 
Very satisfactory! 

Next comes a discussion of trade, which profoundly influenced 
scholastic casuistry. There are two uses of a thing, one proper, 
the other improper; a shoe, for instance, may be worn, which is 
its proper use, or exchanged, which is its improper use. It follows 
that there is something degraded about a shoemaker, who must 
exchange his shoes in order to live. Retail trade, we are told, is 
not a natural part of the art of getting wealth (1257). The natural 
way to get wealth is by skillful management of house and land. 
To the wealth that can be made in this way there is a limit, but 
to what can be made by trade there is none. Trade has to do with 
money, but wealth is not the acquisition of coin. Wealth derived 
from trade is justly hated, because it is unnatural. "The most 
hated sort, and with the greatest reason, is usury, which makes 
a gain out of money itself, and not from the natural object of it. 
For money was intended to be used in exchange, but not to increase 
at interest.... Of all modes of getting wealth this is the most 
unnatural" (1258). 

What came of this dictum you may read in Tawney's _Religion 
and the Rise of Capitalism_. But while his history is reliable, his 
comment has a bias in favor of what is pre-capitalistic. 

"Usury" means all lending money at interest, not only, as now, lending
at an exorbitant rate. From Greek times to the present day, mankind,
or at least the economically more developed portion of them, have been
divided into debtors and creditors; debtors have disapproved of
interest, and creditors have approved of it. At most times, landowners
have been debtors, while men engaged in commerce have been creditors.
The views of philosophers, with few exceptions, have coincided with
the pecuniary interests of their class. Greek philosophers belonged
to, or were employed by, the landowning class; they therefore
disapproved of interest. Medieval philosophers were churchmen, and the
property of the Church was mainly in land; they therefore saw no
reason to revise Aristotle's opinion. Their objection to usury was
reinforced by anti-Semitism, for most fluid capital was Jewish.
Ecclesiastics and barons had their quarrels, sometimes very bitter;
but they could combine against the wicked Jew who had tided them over
a bad harvest by means of a loan, and considered that he deserved
some reward for his thrift.

With the Reformation, the situation changed. Many of the 
most earnest Protestants were business men, to whom lending 
money at interest was essential. Consequently first Calvin, and 
then other Protestant divines, sanctioned interest. At last the 
Catholic Church was compelled to follow suit, because the old 
prohibitions did not suit the modern world. Philosophers, whose 
incomes are derived from the investments of universities, have 
favored interest ever since they ceased to be ecclesiastics and 
therefore connected with landowning. At every stage, there has 
been a wealth of theoretical argument to support the economically 
convenient opinion. 

Plato's Utopia is criticized by Aristotle on various grounds. 
There is first the very interesting comment that it gives too much 
unity to the State, and would make it into an individual. Next 
comes the kind of argument against the proposed abolition of the 
family that naturally occurs to every reader. Plato thinks that, by 
merely giving the title of "son" to all who are of an age that makes 
their sonship possible, a man will acquire towards the whole 
multitude the sentiments that men have at present towards their 
actual sons, and correlatively as regards the title "father." Aristotle, 
on the contrary, says that what is common to the greatest number 
receives the least care, and that if "sons" are common to many 
"fathers" they will be neglected in common; it is better to be 
a cousin in reality than a "son" in Plato's sense; Plato's plan would 
make love watery. Then there is a curious argument that, since 
abstinence from adultery is a virtue, it would be a pity to have 
a social system which abolishes this virtue and the correlative 
vice (1263). Then we are asked: if women are common, who 
will manage the house? I wrote an essay once, called "Architecture 
and the Social System," in which I pointed out that all who 
combine communism with abolition of the family also advocate 
communal houses for large numbers, with communal kitchens, 
dining-rooms, and nurseries. This system may be described as 
monasteries without celibacy. It is essential to the carrying out of 
Plato's plans, but it is certainly not more impossible than many 
other things that he recommends. 

Plato's communism annoys Aristotle. It would lead, he says, 
to anger against lazy people, and to the sort of quarrels that are 
common between fellow travellers. It is better if each minds his 
own business. Property should be private, but people should be 
so trained in benevolence as to allow the use of it to be largely 
common. Benevolence and generosity are virtues, and without 
pr vate property they are impossible. Finally we are told that, if 
Plato's plans were good, someone would have thought of them 
sooner.[^72] I do not agree with Plato, but if anything could make 
me do so, it would be Aristotle's arguments against him. 

[^72]: _Cf_. The Noodle's Oration in Sydney Smith: "If the proposal be sound, would the Saxon have passed it by? Would the Dane have ignored it? Would it have escaped the wisdom of the Norman?" (I quote from memory.) 

As we have seen in connection with slavery, Aristotle is no 
believer in equality. Granted, however, the subjection of slaves 
and women, it still remains a question whether all citizens should 
be politically equal. Some men, he says, think this desirable, on 
the ground that all revolutions turn on the regulation of property, 
lie rejects this argument, maintaining that the greatest crimes 
are due to excess rather than want; no man becomes a tyrant in 
order to avoid feeling the cold. 

A government is good when it aims at the good of the whole community,
bad when it cares only for itself. There are three kinds of government
that are good: monarchy, aristocracy, and constitutional government
(or polity); there are three that are bad: tyranny, oligarchy, and
democracy. There are also many mixed intermediate forms. It will be
observed that the good and bad governments are defined by the ethical
qualities of the holders of power, not by the form of the
constitution. This, however, is only partly true. An aristocracy is a
rule of men of virtue, an oligarchy is a rule of the rich, and
Aristotle does not consider virtue and wealth strictly synonymous.
What he holds, in accordance with the doctrine of the golden mean, is
that a moderate competence is most likely to be associated with
virtue: "Mankind do not acquire or preserve virtue by the help of
external goods, but external goods by the help of virtue, and
happiness, whether consisting in pleasure or virtue, or both, is more
often found with those who are most highly cultivated in their mind
and in their character, and have only a moderate share of external
goods, than among those who possess external goods to a useless extent
but are deficient in higher qualities" (1323). There is therefore a
difference between the rule of the best (aristocracy) and of the
richest (oligarchy), since the best are likely to have only moderate
fortunes. There is also a difference between democracy and polity, in
addition to the ethical difference in the government, for what
Aristotle calls "polity" retains some oligarchic elements (1293). But
between monarchy and tyranny the only difference is ethical.

He is emphatic in distinguishing oligarchy and democracy by the
economic status of the governing party: there is oligarchy when the
rich govern without consideration for the poor, democracy when power
is in the hands of the needy and they disregard the interest of the
rich.

Monarchy is better than aristocracy, aristocracy is better than 
polity. But the corruption of the best is worst; therefore tyranny 
is worse than oligarchy, and oligarchy than democracy. In this 
way Aristotle arrives at a qualified defense of democracy; for 
most actual governments are bad, and therefore, among actual 
governments, democracies tend to be best. 

The Greek conception of democracy was in many ways more extreme than
ours; for instance, Aristotle says that to elect magistrates is
oligarchic, while it is democratic to appoint them by lot. In extreme
democracies, the assembly of the citizens was above the law, and
decided each question independently. The Athenian law-courts were
composed of a large number of citizens chosen by lot, unaided by any
jurist; they were, of course, liable to be swayed by eloquence or
party passion. When democracy is criticized, it must be understood
that this sort of thing is meant.

There is a long discussion of causes of revolution. In Greece, 
revolutions were as frequent as formerly in Latin America, and 
therefore Aristotle had a copious experience from which to draw 
inferences. The main cause was the conflict of oligarchs and 
democrats. Democracy, Aristotle says, arises from the belief that 
men who are equally free should be equal in all respects; oligarchy, 
from the fact that men who are superior in some respect claim 
too much. Both have a kind of justice, but not the best kind. 
"Therefore both parties, whenever their share in the government 
does not accord with their preconceived ideas, stir up revolution" 
(1301). Democratic governments are less liable to revolutions 
than oligarchies, because oligarchs may fall out with each other. 
The oligarchs seem to have been vigorous fellows. In some cities, 
we are told, they swore an oath: "I will be an enemy to the people, 
and will devise all the harm against them which I can." Nowadays 
reactionaries are not so frank. 

The three things needed to prevent revolution are government 
propaganda in education, respect for law, even in small things, 
and justice in law and administration, i.e., "equality according 
to proportion, and for every man to enjoy his own" (1307, 
1307, 1310). Aristotle never seems to have realized the difficulty 
of "equality according to proportion." If this is to be true justice, 
the proportion must be of virtue. Now virtue is difficult to measure, 
and is a matter of party controversy. In political practice, therefore, 
virtue tends to be measured by income; the distinction between 
aristocracy and oligarchy, which Aristotle attempts to make, is 
only possible where there is a very well-established hereditary 
nobility. Even then, as soon as there exists a large class of rich 
men who are not noble, they have to be admitted to power for 
fear of their making a revolution. Hereditary aristocracies cannot 
long retain their power except where land is almost the only 
source of wealth. All social inequality, in the long run, is inequality 
of income. That is part of the argument for democracy: that the 
attempt to have a "proportionate justice" based on any merit 
other than wealth is sure to break down. Defenders of oligarchy 
pretend that income is proportional to virtue; the prophet said 
he had never seen a righteous man begging his bread, and Aristotle 
thinks that good men acquire just about his own income, neither 
very large nor very small. But such views are absurd. Every kind 
of "justice" other than absolute equality will, in practice, reward 
some quality quite other than virtue, and is therefore to be 
condemned. 

There is an interesting section on tyranny. A tyrant desires riches,
whereas a king desires honor. The tyrant has guards who are
mercenaries, whereas the king has guards who are citizens. Tyrants are
mostly demagogues, who acquire power by promising to protect the
people against the notables. In an ironically Machiavellian tone,
Aristotle explains what a tyrant must do to retain power. He must
prevent the rise of any person of exceptional merit, by execution or
assassination if necessary. He must prohibit common meals, clubs, and
any education likely to produce hostile sentiment. There must be no
literary assemblies or discussions. He must prevent people from
knowing each other well, and compel them to live in public at his
gates. He should employ spies, like the female detectives at Syracuse.
He must sow quarrels, and impoverish his subjects. He should keep them
occupied in great works, as the king of Egypt did in getting the
pyramids built. He should give power to women and slaves, to make them
informers. He should make war, in order that his subjects may have
something to do and be always in want of a leader (1313).

It is a melancholy reflection that this passage is, of the whole book,
the one most appropriate to the present day. Aristotle concludes that
there is no wickedness too great for a tyrant. There is, however, he
says, another method of preserving a tyranny, namely by moderation and
by seeming religious. There is no decision as to which method is
likely to prove the more successful.

There is a long argument to prove that foreign conquest is not 
the end of the State, showing that many people took the imperialist 
view. There is, it is true, an exception: conquest of "natural 
slaves" is right and just. This would, in Aristotle's view, justify 
wars against barbarians, but not against Greeks, for no Greeks 
are '"natural slaves." In general, war is only a means, not an end; 
a city in an isolated situation, where conquest is not possible, 
may be happy; States that live in isolation need not be inactive. 
God and the universe are active, though foreign conquest is 
impossible for them. The happiness that a State should seek, 
therefore, though war may sometimes be a necessary means to it, 
should not be war, but the activities of peace. 

This leads to the question: how large should a State be? Large cities,
we are told, are never well governed, because a great multitude cannot
be orderly. A State ought to be large enough to be more or less
self-sufficing, but not too large for constitutional government. It
ought to be small enough for the citizens to know each other's
characters, otherwise right will not be done in elections and
law-suits. The territory should be small enough to be surveyed in its
entirety from a hill-top. We are told both that it should be
self-sufficient (1326) and that it should have an export and import
trade (1327), which seems an inconsistency.

Men who work for their living should not be admitted to citizenship.
"Citizens should not lead the life of mechanics or tradesmen, for such
a life is ignoble and inimical to virtue." Nor should they be
husbandmen, because they need leisure. The citizens should own the
property, but the husbandmen should be slaves of a different race
(1330). Northern races, we are told, are spirited; southern races,
intelligent; therefore slaves should be of southern races, since it is
inconvenient if they are spirited. The Greeks alone are both spirited
and intelligent; they are better governed than barbarians, and if
united could rule the world (1327). One might have expected at this
point some allusion to Alexander, but there is none.

With regard to the size of States, Aristotle makes, on a different 
scale, the same mistake that is made by many modern liberals. 
A State must be able to defend itself in war, and even, if any 
liberal culture is to survive, to defend itself without very great 
difficulty. I low large this requires a State to be, depends upon the 
technique of war and industry. In Aristotle's day, the City State 
was obsolete because it could not defend itself against Macedonia. 
In our day, Greece as a whole, including Macedonia, is obsolete 
in this sense, as has been recently proved.[^73] To advocate complete 
independence for Greece, or any other small country, is now as 
futile as to advocate complete independence for a single city, 
whose territory can be seen entire from an eminence. There can 
be no true independence except for a State or alliance strong 
enough, by its own efforts, to repel all attempts at foreign conquest. 
Nothing smaller than America and the British Empire combined 
will satisfy this requirement; and perhaps even this would be 
too small a unit. 

[^73]: This was written in May, 1941. 


The book, which, in the form in which we have it, appears to be
unfinished, ends with a discussion of education. Education, of course,
is only for children who are going to be citizens; slaves may be
taught useful arts, such as cooking, but these are no part of
education. The citizen should be moulded to the form of government
under which he lives, and there should therefore be differences
according as the city in question is oligarchic or democratic. In the
discussion, however, Aristotle assumes that the citizens will all have
a share of political power. Children should learn what is useful to
them, but not vulgarizing; for instance, they should not be taught any
skill that deforms the body, or that would enable them to earn money.
They should practice athletics in moderation, but not to the point of
acquiring professional skill; the boys who train for the Olympic games
suffer in health, as is shown by the fact that those who have been
victors as boys are hardly ever victors as men. Children should learn
drawing, in order to appreciate the beauty of the human form; and they
should be taught to appreciate such painting and sculpture as
expresses moral ideas. They may learn to sing and to play musical
instruments enough to be able to enjoy music critically, but not
enough to be skilled performers; for no freeman would play or sing
unless drunk. They must of course, learn to read and write, in spite
of the usefulness of these arts. But the purpose of education is
"virtue," not usefulness. What Aristotle means by "virtue" he has told
us in the _Ethics_, to which this book frequently refers.

Aristotle's fundamental assumptions, in his _Politics_, are very
different from those of any modern writer. The aim of the State, in
his view, is to produce cultured gentlemen men who combine the
aristocratic mentality with love of learning and the arts This
combination existed, in its highest perfection, in the Athens of
Pericles, not in the population at large, but among the well-to-do. It
began to break down in the last years of Pericles. The populace, who
had no culture, turned against the friends of Pericles, who were
driven to defend the privileges of the rich, by treachery,
assassination, illegal despotism, and other such not very gentlemanly
methods. After the death of Socrates, the bigotry of the Athenian
democracy diminished, and Athens remained the center of ancient
culture, but political power went elsewhere. Throughout later
antiquity, power and culture were usually separate: power was in the
hands of rough soldiers, culture belonged to powerless Greeks, often
slaves. This is only partially true of Rome in its great days, but it
is emphatically true before Cicero and after Marcus Aurelius. After
the barbarian invasion, the "gentlemen" were northern barbarians, the
men of culture subtle southern ecclesiastics. This state of affairs
continued, more or less, until the Renaissance, when the laity began
to acquire culture. From the Renaissance onwards, the Creek conception
of government by cultured gentlemen gradually prevailed more and more,
reaching its acme in the eighteenth century.

Various forces have put an end to this state of affairs. First, 
democracy, as embodied in the French Revolution and its aftermath. The cultured gentlemen, as after the age of Pericles, had 
to defend their privileges against the populace, and in the process 
ceased to he either gentlemen or cultured. A second cause was 
the rise of industrialism, with a scientific technique very different 
from traditional culture. A third cause was popular education, 
which conferred the power to read and write, but did not confer 
culture; this enabled a new type of demagogue to practice a new 
type of propaganda, as seen in the dictatorships. 

Both for good and evil, therefore, the day of the cultured 
gentleman is past. 

## Chapter XXII ARISTOTLE'S LOGIC 

Aristotle's influence, which was very great in many different fields,
was greatest of all in logic. In late antiquity, when Plato was still
supreme in metaphysics, Aristotle was the recognized authority in
logic, and he retained this position throughout the Middle Ages. It
was not till the thirteenth century that Christian philosophers
accorded him supremacy in the field of metaphysics. This supremacy was
largely lost after the Renaissance, but his supremacy in logic
survived. Even at the present day, all Catholic teachers of philosophy
and many others still obstinately reject the discoveries of modern
logic, and adhere with a strange tenacity to a system which is as
definitely antiquated as Ptolemaic astronomy. This makes it difficult
to do historical justice to Aristotle. His present-day influence is so
inimical to clear thinking that it is hard to remember how great an
advance he made upon all his predecessors (including Plato), or how
admirable his logical work would still seem if it had been a stage in
a continual progress, instead of being (as in fact it was) a dead end,
followed by over two thousand years of stagnation. In dealing with the
predecessors of Aristotle, it is not necessary to remind the reader
that they are not verbally inspired; one can therefore praise them for
their ability without being supposed to subscribe to all their
doctrines. Aristotle, on the contrary, is still, especially in logic,
a battle-ground, and cannot be treated in a purely historical spirit.

Aristotle's most important work in logic is the doctrine of the 
syllogism. A syllogism is an argument consisting of three parts, a 
major premiss, a minor premiss, and a conclusion. Syllogisms 
are of a number of different kinds, each of which has a name, 
given by the scholastics. The most familiar is the kind called 
"Barbara": 

> All men are mortal (Major premiss).  
> Socrates is a man (Minor premiss).  
> Therefore: Socrates is mortal (Conclusion)  

> Or: all men are mortal.  
> All Greeks are men.  
> Therefore: All Greeks are mortal.  

(Aristotle docs not distinguish between these two forms; this, as 
we shall see later, is a mistake.) 

Other forms are: No fishes are rational, oil sharks are fishes, 
therefore no sharks are rational. (This is called "Celarent.") 

All men are rational, some animals are men, therefore some 
animals are rational. (This is called "Darii.") 

No Greeks are black, some men are Greeks, therefore some men 
are not black. (This is called "Ferio.") 

These four make up the "first figure"; Aristotle adds a second 
and third figure, and the schoolmen added a fourth. It is shown 
that the three later figures can be reduced to the first by various 
devices. 

There are some inferences that can be made from a single 
premiss. From "some men are mortal" we can infer that "some 
mortals are men." According to Aristotle, this can be also inferred 
from "all men are mortal." From "no gods are mortal" we can 
infer "no mortals are gods," but from "some men are not Greeks" 
it does not follow that "some Greeks are not men." 

Apart from such inferences as the above, Aristotle and his followers
thought that all deductive inference, when strictly stated, is
syllogistic. By setting forth all the valid kinds of syllogism, and
setting out any suggested argument in syllogistic form, it should
therefore be possible to avoid all fallacies.

This system was the beginning of formal logic, and, as such, was 
both important and admirable. But considered as the end, not the 
beginning, of formal logic, it is open to three kinds of criticism: 

(1) Formal defects within the system itself. 

(2) Over-estimation of the syllogism, as compared to other 
forms of deductive argument. 

(3) Over-estimation of deduction as a form of argument. 
On each of these three, something must be said. 

(1) _Formal defects_. Let us begin with the two statements 
"Socrates is a man" and "all Greeks are men." It is necessary to 
make a sharp distinction between these two, which is not done 
in Aristotelian logic. The statement "all Greeks arc men" is 
commonly interpreted as implying that there are Greeks: without 
this implication, some of Aristotle's syllogisms are not valid. 
Take for instance: 

"All Greeks are men, All Greeks are white, therefore some men are
white." This is valid if there are Greeks, but not otherwise. If I
were to say:

"All golden mountains are mountains, all golden mountains 
are golden, therefore some mountains are golden," my conclusion 
would be false, though in some sense my premisses would be 
true. If we are to be explicit, we must therefore divide the one 
statement "all Greeks are men" into two, one saying "there are 
Greeks," and the other saying "if anything is a Greek it is a man." 
The latter statement is purely hypothetical, and does not imply 
that there are Greeks. 

The statement "all Greeks are men" is thus much more complex in form
than the statement "Socrates is a man." "Socrates is a man" has
"Socrates" for its subject, but "all Greeks are men" does not have
"all Greeks" for its subject, for there is nothing about "all Greeks"
either in the statement "there are Greeks," or in the statement "if
anything is a Greek it is a man."

This purely formal error was a source of errors in metaphysics 
and theory of knowledge. Consider the state of our knowledge in 
regard to the two propositions "Socrates is mortal" and "all men 
are mortal." In order to know the truth of "Socrates is mortal," 
most of us are content to rely upon testimony; but if testimony 
is to be reliable, it must lead us back to some one who knew 
Socrates and saw him dead. The one perceived fact the dead 
body of Socrates together with the knowledge that this was 
called "Socrates," was enough to assure us of the mortality 
of Socrates. But when it comes to "all men are mortal," the 
matter is different. The question of our knowledge of such 
general propositions is a very difficult one. Sometimes they are 
merely verbal: "all Greeks are men" is known because nothing 
is called "a Greek" unless it is a man. Such general statements 
can be ascertained from the dictionary; they tell us nothing about 
the world except how words are used. But "all men are mortal" 
is not of this sort; there is nothing logically self-contradictory 
about an immortal man. We believe the proposition on the basis 
of induction, because there is no well-authenticated case of a 
man living more than (say) 150 years; but this only makes the 
proposition probable, not certain. It cannot be certain so long as 
living men exist. 

Metaphysical errors arose through supposing that "all men" is 
the subject of "all men are mortal" in the same sense as that in 
which "Socrates" is the subject of "Socrates is mortal." It made 
it possible to hold that, in some sense, "all men" denotes an entity 
of the same sort as that denoted by "Socrates." This led Aristotle 
to say that in a sense a species is a substance. He is careful to 
qualify this statement, but his followers, especially Porphyry, 
showed less caution. 

Another error into which Aristotle falls through this mistake 
is to think that a predicate of a predicate can be a predicate of 
the original subject. If I say "Socrates is Greek, all Greeks are 
human," Aristotle thinks that "human" is a predicate of "Greek," 
while "Greek" is a predicate of "Socrates," and obviously "human" 
is a predicate of "Socrates." But in fact "human" is not a predicate 
of "Greek." The distinction between names and predicates, or 
in metaphysical language, between particulars and universals, 
is thus blurred, with disastrous consequences to philosophy. One 
of the resulting confusions was to suppose that a class with only 
one member is identical with that one member. This made it 
impossible to have a correct theory of the number one, and led 
to endless bad metaphysics about unity. 

(2) Over-estimation of the syllogism. The syllogism is only one kind
of deductive argument. In mathematics, which is wholly deductive,
syllogisms hardly ever occur. Of course, it would be possible to
re-write mathematical arguments in syllogistic form, but this would he
very artificial and would not make them any more cogent. Take
arithmetic, for example. If I buy goods worth 16s. 3d., and tender a 1
pound note in payment, how much change is due to me? To put this
simple sum in the form of a syllogism would be absurd, and would tend
to conceal the real nature of the argument. Again, within logic there
are non-syllogistic inferences such as: "A horse is an animal,
therefore a horse's head is an animal's head." Valid syllogisms, in
fact, are only some among valid deductions, and have no logical
priority over others. The attempt to give pre-eminence to the
syllogism in deduction misled philosophers as to the nature of
mathematical reasoning. Kant, who perceived that mathematics is not
syllogistic, inferred that it uses extra-logical principles, which,
however, he supposed to be as certain as those of logic. He, like his
predecessors, though in a different way, was misled by respect for
Aristotle.

(3) Over-estimation of deduction. The Greeks in general attached more
importance to deduction as a source of knowledge than modern
philosophers do. In this respect, Aristotle was less at fault than
Plato; he repeatedly admitted the importance of induction, and he
devoted considerable attention to the question: how do we know the
first premisses from which deduction must start? Nevertheless, he,
like other Greeks, gave undue prominence to deduction in his theory of
knowledge. We shall agree that Mr. Smith (say) is mortal, and we may,
loosely, say that we know this because we know that all men are
mortal. But what we really know is not "all men are mortal"; we know
either something like "all men born more than one hundred and fifty
years ago are mortal, and so are almost all men born more than one
hundred years ago." This is our reason for thinking that Mr. Smith
will die. But this argument is an induction, not a deduction. It has
less cogency than a deduction, and yields only a probability, not a
certainty; but on the other hand it gives new knowledge, which
deduction does not. All the important inferences outside logic and
pure mathematics are inductive, not deductive; the only exceptions are
law and theology, each of which derives its first principles from an
unquestionable text, viz. the statute hooks or the scriptures.

Apart from _The Prior Analytics_, which deals with the syllogism there
are other logical writings of Aristotle which have considerable
importance in the history of philosophy. One of these is the short
work on The Categories. Porphyry the Neoplatonist wrote a commentary
on this book, which had a very notable influence on medieval
philosophy; but for the present let us ignore Porphyry and confine
ourselves to Aristotle.

What, exactly, is meant by the word "category," whether in 
Aristotle or in Kant and Hegel, I must confess that I have never 
been able to understand. I do not myself believe that the term 
"category" is in any way useful in philosophy, as representing 
any clear idea. There are, in Aristotle, ten categories: substance, 
quantity, quality, relation, place, time, position, state, action, 
and affection. The only definition offered of the term "category" 
is: "expressions which are in no way composite signify" and 
then follows the above list. This seems to mean that every word 
of which the meaning is not compounded of the meanings of 
other words signifies a substance or a quantity or etc. There is 
no suggestion of any principle on which the list of ten categories 
has been compiled. 

"Substance" is primarily what is not predicable of a subject nor 
present in a subject. A thing is said to be "present in a subject" 
when, though not a part of the subject, it cannot exist without 
the subject. The instances given are a piece of grammatical 
knowledge which is present in a mind, and a certain whiteness 
which may be present in a body. A substance in the above primary 
sense is an individual thing or person or animal. But in a secondary 
sense a species or a genus e.g. "man" or "animal" may be 
called a substance. This secondary sense seems indefensible, 
and opened the door, in later writers, to much bad metaphysics. 

_The Posterior Analytics_ is a work largely concerned with a question
which must trouble any deductive theory, namely: How are first
premisses obtained? Since deduction must start from somewhere, we must
begin with something unproved, which must be known otherwise than by
demonstration. I shall not give Aristotle's theory in detail, since it
depends upon the notion of essence. A definition, he says, is a
statement of a thing's essential nature. The notion of essence is an
intimate part of every philosophy subsequent to Aristotle, until we
come to modern times. It is, in my opinion, a hopelessly muddle-headed
notion, but its historical importance requires us to say something
about it.

The "essence" of a thing appears to have meant "those of its
properties which it cannot change without losing its identity."
Socrates may be sometimes happy, sometimes sad; sometimes well,
sometimes ill. Since he can change these properties without ceasing to
be Socrates, they are no part of his essence. But it is supposed to be
of the essence of Socrates that he is a man, though a Pythagorean, who
believes in transmigration, will not admit this. In fact, the question
of "essence" is one as to the use of words. We apply the same name, on
different occasions, to somewhat different occurrences, which .we
regard as manifestations of a single "thing" or "person." In fact,
however, this is only a verbal convenience. The "essence" of Socrates
thus consists of those properties in the absence of which we should
not use the name "Socrates." The question is purely linguistic: a word
may have an essence, but a thing cannot.

The conception of "substance," like that of "essence," is a 
transference to metaphysics of what is only a linguistic convenience. 
We find it convenient, in describing the world, to describe a 
certain number of occurrences as events in the life of "Socrates," 
and a certain number of others as events in the life of "Mr. Smith." 
This leads us to think of "Socrates" or "Mr. Smith" as denoting 
something that persists through a certain number of years, and 
as in some way more "solid" and "real" than the events that 
happen to him. If Socrates is ill, we think that Socrates, at other 
times, is well, and therefore the being of Socrates is independent 
of his illness; illness, on the other hand, requires somebody to 
be ill. But although Socrates need not be ill, something must be 
occurring to him if he is to be considered to exist. He is not, 
therefore, really any more "solid" than the things that happen 
to him. 

"Substance," when taken seriously, is a concept impossible to 
free from difficulties. A substance is supposed to be the subject 
of properties, and to be something distinct from all its properties. 
But when we take away the properties, and try to imagine the 
substance by itself, we find that there is nothing left. To put the 
matter in another way: What distinguishes one substance from 
another? Not difference of properties, for, according to the logic 
of substance, difference of properties presupposes numerical 
diversity between the substances concerned. Two substances, 
therefore, must be just two, without being, in themselves, in any 
way distinguishable. How, then, are we ever to find out that 
they are two? 

"Substance," in fact, is merely a convenient way of collecting 
events into bundles. What can we know about Mr. Smith? When 
we look at him, we see a pattern of colors; when we listen to him 
talking, we hear a series of sounds. We believe that, like us, he has 
thoughts and feelings. But what is Mr. Smith apart from all these 
occurrences? A mere imaginary hook, from which the occurrences 
are supposed to hang. They have in fact no need of a hook, any 
more than the earth needs an elephant to rest upon. Any one 
can see, in the analogous case of a geographical region, that such 
a word as "France" (say) is only a linguistic convenience, and that 
there is not a thing called "France" over and above its various 
parts. The same holds of "Mr. Smith"; it is a collective name 
for a number of occurrences. If we take it as anything more, it 
denotes something completely unknowable, and therefore not 
needed for the expression of what we know. 

"Substance," in a word, is a metaphysical mistake, due to 
transference to the world-structure of the structure of sentences 
composed of a subject and a predicate. 

I conclude that the Aristotelian doctrines with which we have 
been concerned in this chapter are wholly false, with the exception 
of the formal theory of the syllogism, which is unimportant. 
Any person in the present day who wishes to learn logic will be 
wasting his time if he reads Aristotle or any of his disciples. 
None the less, Aristotle's logical writings show great ability, and 
would have been useful to mankind if they had appeared at a 
time when intellectual originality was still active. Unfortunately, 
they appeared at the very end of the creative period of Greek 
thought, and therefore came to be accepted as authoritative. 
By the time that logical originality revived, a reign of two thousand 
years had made Aristotle very difficult to dethrone. Throughout 
modern times, practically every advance in science, in logic, or 
in philosophy has had to be made in the teeth of opposition from 
Aristotle's disciples. 

## Chapter XXIII ARISTOTLE'S PHYSICS 

In this chapter I propose to consider two of Aristotle's books, 
the one called _Physics_ and the one called _On the Heavens_. 
These two books are closely connected; the second takes up 
the argument at the point at which the first has left it. Both were 
extremely influential, and dominated science until the time of 
Galileo. Words such as "quintessence" and "sublunary" are 
derived from the theories expressed in these books. The historian 
of philosophy, accordingly, must study them, in spite of the fact 
that hardly a sentence in either can be accepted in the light of 
modern science. 

To understand the views of Aristotle, as of most Greeks, on physics,
it is necessary to apprehend their imaginative background. Every
philosopher, in addition to the formal system which he offers to the
world, has another, much simpler, of which he may be quite unaware. If
he is aware of it, he probably realizes that it won't quite do; he
therefore conceals it, and sets forth something more sophisticated,
which he believes because it is like his crude system, but which he
asks others to accept because he thinks he has made it such as cannot
be disproved. The sophistication comes in by way of refutation of
refutations, but this alone will never give a positive result: it
shows, at best, that a theory may be true, not that it must be. The
positive result, however little the philosopher may realize it, is due
to his imaginative preconceptions, or to what Santayana calls "animal
faith."

In relation to physics, Aristotle's imaginative background was 
very different from that of a modern student. Nowadays, a boy 
begins with mechanics, which, by its very name, suggests machines. 
He is accustomed to motor-cars and airplanes; he does not, 
even in the dimmest recesses of his subconscious imagination, 
think that a motor-car contains some sort of horse in its inside, 
or that an airplane flies because its wings are those of a bird 
possessing magical powers. Animals have lost their importance 
in our imaginative pictures of the world, in which man stands 
comparatively alone as master of a mainly lifeless and largely 
subservient material environment. 

To the Greek, attempting to give a scientific account of motion, 
the purely mechanical view hardly suggested itself, except in the 
case of a few men of genius such as Democritus and Archimedes. 
Two sets of phenomena seemed important: the movements of 
animals, and the movements of the heavenly bodies. To the 
modern man of science, the body of an animal is a very elaborate 
machine, with an enormously complex physico-chemical structure; 
every new discovery consists in diminishing the apparent gulf 
between animals and machines. To the Greek, it seemed more 
natural to assimilate apparently lifeless motions to those of animals. 
A child still distinguishes live animals from other things by the 
fact that they can move of themselves; to many Greeks, and 
especially to Aristotle, this peculiarity suggested itself as the basis 
of a general theory of physics. 

But how about the heavenly bodies? They differ from animals by the
regularity of their movements, but this may be only due to their
superior perfection. Every Greek philosopher, whatever he may have
come to think in adult life, had been taught in childhood to regard
the sun and moon as gods; Anaxagoras was prosecuted for impiety
because he thought that they were not alive. It was natural that a
philosopher who could no longer regard the heavenly bodies themselves
as divine should think of them as moved by the will of a Divine Being
who had a Hellenic love of order and geometrical simplicity. Thus the
ultimate source of all movement is Will: on earth the capricious Will
of human beings and animals, but in heaven the unchanging Will of the
Supreme Artificer.

I do not suggest that this applies to every detail of what Aristotle
has to say. What I do suggest is that it gives his imaginative
background, and represents the sort of thing which, in embarking on
liis investigations, he would expect to find true.

After these preliminaries, let us examine what it is that he 
actually says. 

Physics, in Aristotle, is the science of what the Greeks called
"phusis" (or "physis"), a word which is translated "nature," but has
not exactly the meaning which we attach to that word. We still speak
of "natural science" and "natural history," but "nature" by itself,
though it is a very ambiguous word, seldom means just what "phusis"
meant. "Phusis" had to do with growth; one might sav it is the
"nature" of an acorn to grow into an oak, and in that case one would
be using the word in the Aristotelian sense. The "nature" of a thing,
Aristotle says, is its end, that for the sake of which it exists. Thus
the word has a ideological implication. Some things exist by nature,
some from other causes. Animals, plants, and simple bodies (elements)
exist by nature; they have an internal principle of motion (the word
translated "motion" or "movement" has a wider meaning than
"locomotion"; in addition to locomotion it includes change of quality
or of size.) Nature is a source of being moved or at rest. Things
"have a nature" if they have an internal principle of this kind. The
phrase "according to nature" applies to these things and their
essential attributes. (It was through this point of view that
"unnatural" came to express blame.) Nature is in form rather than in
matter; what is potentially flesh or bone has not yet acquired its own
nature, and a thing is more what it is when it has attained to
fulfillment. This whole point of view seems to be suggested by biology:
the acorn is "potentially" an oak.

Nature belongs to the class of causes which operate for the sake 
of something. This leads to a discussion of the view that nature 
works of necessity, without purpose, in connection with which 
Aristotle discusses the survival of the fittest, in the form taught 
by Empedocles. This cannot be right, he says, because things 
happen in fixed ways, and when a series has a completion, all 
preceding steps are for its sake. Those things are "natural" which 
"by a continuous movement, originated from an internal principle, 
arrive at some completion" (199). 

This whole conception of "nature," though it might well seem 
admirably suited to explain the growth of animals and plants, 
became, in the event, a great obstacle to the progress of science, 
and a source of much that was bad in ethics. In the latter respect, 
it is still harmful. 

Motion, we are told, is the fulfilling of what exists potentially. 
This view, apart from other defects, is incompatible with the 
relativity of locomotion. When A moves relatively to B, B moves 
relatively to A, and there is no sense in saying that one of the two 
is in motion while the other is at rest. When a dog seizes a bone, 
it seems to common sense that the dog moves while the bone 
remains at rest (until seized), and that the motion has a purpose, 
namely to fulfill the dog's "nature." But it has turned out that this 
point of view cannot be applied to dead matter, and that, for the 
purposes of scientific physics, no conception of an "end" is useful, 
nor can any motion, in scientific strictness, be treated as other 
than relative. 

Aristotle rejects the void, as maintained by Leucippus and 
Democritus. He then passes on to a rather curious discussion of 
time. It might, he says, be maintained that time does not exist, 
since it is composed of past and future, of which one no longer 
exists while the other does not yet exist. This view, however, he 
rejects. Time, he says, is motion that admits of numeration. (It is 
not clear why he thinks numeration essential.) We may fairly ask, 
he continues, whether time could exist without the soul, since there 
cannot be anything to count unless there is someone to count, 
and time involves numeration. It seems that he thinks of time as 
so many hours or days or years. Some things, he adds, are eternal, 
in the sense of not being in time; presumably he is thinking of 
such things as numbers. 

There always has been motion, and there always will be; for 
there cannot be time without motion, and all are agreed that time 
is uncreated, except Plato. On this point, Christian followers of 
Aristotle were obliged to dissent from him, since the Bible tells 
us that the universe had a beginning. 

The _Physics_ ends with the argument for an unmoved mover, 
which we considered in connection with the _Metaphysics_. There 
is one unmoved mover, which directly causes a circular motion. 
Circular motion is the primary kind, and the only kind which 
can be continuous and infinite. The first mover has no parts or 
magnitude and is at the circumference of the world. 

Having reached this conclusion, we pass on to the heavens. 

The treatise _On the Heavens_ sets forth a pleasant and simple theory.
Things below the moon are subject to generation and decay; from the
moon upwards, everything is ungenerated and indestructible. The earth,
which is spherical, is at the center of the universe. In the sublunary
sphere, everything is composed of the four elements, earth, water,
air, and fire; but there is a fifth element, of which the heavenly
bodies are composed. The natural movement of the terrestrial elements
is rectilinear, but that of the fifth clement is circular. The heavens
are perfectly spherical, and the upper regions are more divine than
the lower. The stars and planets are not composed of fire, hut of the
fifth element; their motion is due to that of spheres to which they
are attached. (All this appears in poetical form in Dante's
_Paradiso_.)

The four terrestrial elements are not eternal, but are generated out
of each other---fire is absolutely light, in the sense that its
natural motion is upward; earth is absolutely heavy. Air is relatively
light, and water is relatively heavy.

This theory provided many difficulties for later ages. Comets, 
which were recognized as destructible, had to be assigned to the 
sublunary sphere, but in the seventeenth century it was found 
that they describe orbits round the sun, and are very seldom as 
near as the moon. Since the natural motion of terrestrial bodies 
is rectilinear, it was held that a projectile fired horizontally will 
move horizontally for a time, and then suddenly begin to fall 
vertically. Galileo's discovery that a projectile moves in a parabola 
shocked his Aristotelian colleagues. Copernicus, Kepler, and 
Galileo had to combat Aristotle as well as the Bible in establishing 
the view that the earth is not the center of the universe, but rotates 
once a day and goes round the sun once a year. 

To come to a more general matter: Aristotelian physics is incompatible
with Newton's "First Law of Motion," originally enunciated by Galileo.
This law states that every body, left to itself, will, if already in
motion, continue to move in a straight line with uniform velocity.
Thus outside causes are required, not to account for motion, but to
account for change of motion, either in velocity or in direction.
Circular motion, which Aristotle thought "natural" for the heavenly
bodies, involves a continual change in the direction of motion, and
therefore requires a force directed towards the center of the circle,
as in Newton's law of gravitation.

Finally: The view that the heavenly bodies are eternal and
incorruptible has had to be abandoned. The sun and stars have long
lives, but do not live for ever. They are born from a nebula, and in
the end they either explode or die of cold. Nothing in the visible
world is exempt from change and decay; the Aristotelian belief to the
contrary, though accepted by medieval Christians, is a product of the
pagan worship of sun and moon and planets.


## Chapter XXIV EARLY GREEK MATHEMATICS AND ASTRONOMY 

I am concerned in this chapter with mathematics, not on its own
account, but as it was related to Greek philosophy a relation which,
especially in Plato, was very close. The preeminence of the Greeks
appears more clearly in mathematics and astronomy than in anything
else. What they did in art, in literature, and in philosophy, may be
judged better or worse according to taste, but what they accomplished
in geometry is wholly beyond question. They derived something from
Egypt, and rather less from Babylonia; but what they obtained from
these sources was, in mathematics, mainly simple rules, and in
astronomy records of observations extended over very long periods. The
art of mathematical demonstration was, almost wholly, Greek in origin.
There are many pleasant stories, probably unhistorical, showing what
practical problems stimulated mathematical investigations. The
earliest and simplest relates to Thales, who, when in Egypt, was asked
by the king to find out the height of a pyramid. He waited for the
time of day when his shadow was as long as he was tall; he then
measured the shadow of the pyramid, which was of course equal to its
height. It is said that the laws of perspective were first studied by
the geometer Agatharcus, in order to paint scenery for the plays of
Aeschylus. The problem of finding the distance of a ship at sea, which
was said to have been studied by Thales, was correctly solved at an
early stage. One of the great problems that occupied Greek geometers,
that of the duplication of the cube, originated, we are told, with the
priests of a certain temple, who were informed by the oracle that the
god wanted a statue twice as large as the one they had. At first they
thought simply of doubling all the dimensions of the statue, but then
they realized that the result would be eight times as large as the
original, which would involve more expense than the god had demanded.
So they sent a deputation to Plato to ask whether anybody in the
Academy could solve their problem. The geometers took it up, and
worked at it for centuries, producing, incidentally, much admirable
work. The problem is, of course, that of determining the cube root of
2.



The square root of 2, which was the first irrational to be discovered,
was known to the early Pythagoreans, and ingenious methods of
approximating to its value were discovered. The best was as follows:
Form two columns of numbers, which we will call the _a_'s and the
_b_'s; each starts with 1. The next a, at each stage, is formed by
adding the last _a_ and _b_ already obtained; the next _b_ is formed
by adding twice the previous _a_ to the previous _b_. The first 6
pairs so obtained are (1 ,1), (2, 3), (5, 7), (12, 17), (29, 41), (70,
99). In each pair, 2_a_^2 - _b_^2 is 1 or -1. Thus _b_/_a_ is nearly
the square root of two, and at each fresh step it gets nearer. For
instance, the reader may satisfy himself that the square of 99/70 is
very nearly equal to 2.

Pythagoras always a rather misty figure is described by 
Proclus as the first who made geometry a liberal education. Many 
authorities, including Sir Thomas Heath,[^74] believe that he probably 
discovered the theorem that bears his name, to the effect that, in 
a right-angled triangle, the square on the side opposite the right 
angle is equal to the sum of the squares on the other two sides. 
In any case, this theorem was known to the Pythagoreans at a 
very early date. They knew also that the sum of the angles of a 
triangle is two right angles. 

[^74]: _Greek Mathematics_, Vol. I, p. 145.

Irrationals other than the square root of two were studied, in
particular cases, by Theodorus, a contemporary of Socrates, and in a
more general way by Theaetetus, who was roughly contemporary with
Plato, but somewhat older. Democritus wrote a treatise on irrationals,
but very little is known as to its contents. Plato was profoundly
interested in the subject; he mentions the work of Thcodorus and
Theaetetus in the dialogue called after the latter. In the Laws
(819-820), he says that the general ignorance on this subject is
disgraceful, and implies that he himself began to know about it rather
late in life. It had of course an important bearing on the Pythagorean
philosophy.

One of the most important consequences of the discovery of irrationals
was the invention of the geometrical theory of proportion by Eudoxus
(_ca_. 408--_ca_. 355 BC). Before him, there was only the arithmetical
theory of proportion. According to this theory, the ratio of _a_ to
_b_ is equal to the ratio of _c_ to _d_ if _a_ times _d_ is equal to
_b_ times _c_. This definition, in the absence of an arithmetical
theory of irrationals, is only applicable to rationals. Eudoxus,
however, gave a new definition not subject to this restriction, framed
in a manner which suggests the methods of modern analysis. The theory
is developed in Euclid, and has great logical beauty.

Eudoxus also either invented or perfected the "method of exhaustion," which was subsequently used with great success by 
Archimedes. This method is an anticipation of the integral calculus. Take, for example, the question of the area of a circle. You 
can inscribe in a circle a regular hexagon, or a regular dodecagon, 
or a regular polygon of a thousand or a million sides. The area 
of such a polygon, however many sides it has, is proportional to 
the square on the diameter of the circle. The more sides the 
polygon has, the more nearly it becomes equal to the circle. You 
can prove that, if you give the polygon enough sides, its area can 
be got to differ from that of the circle by less than any previously 
assigned area, however small. For this purpose, the "axiom of 
Archimedes" is used. This states (when somewhat simplified) 
that if the greater of two quantities is halved, and then the half 
is halved, and so on, a quantity will be reached, at last, which is 
less than the smaller of the original two quantities. In other words, 
if _a_ is greater than _b_, there is some whole number _n_ such that 2^_n_ 
times _b_ is greater than _a_. 

The method of exhaustion sometimes leads to an exact result, 
as in squaring the parabola, which was done by Archimedes; sometimes, as in the attempt to square the circle, it can only lead to 
successive approximations. The problem of squaring the circle is 
the problem of determining the ratio of the circumference of a 
circle to the diameter, which is called &pi;. Archimedes used the 
approximation 22/7 in calculations; by inscribing and circumscribing 
a regular polygon of 96 sides, he proved that &pi; is less than 3 1/7 and 
greater than 3 10/71. The method could be carried to any required 
degree of approximation, and that is all that any method can do 
in this problem. The use of inscribed and circumscribed polygons 
for approximations to &pi; goes back to Antiphon, who was a 
contemporary of Socrates. 

Euclid, who was still, when I was young, the sole acknowledged 
text-book of geometry for boys, lived at Alexandria, about 300 BC, 
a few years after the death of Alexander and Aristotle. Most of 
his _Elements_ was not original, but the order of propositions, and 
the logical structure, were largely his. The more one studies geometry, the more admirable these are seen to be. The treatment of 
parallels by means of the famous postulate of parallels has the 
twofold merit of rigour in deduction and of not concealing the 
dubiousness of the initial assumption. The theory of proportion, 
which follows Eudoxus, avoids all the difficulties connected with 
irrationals, by methods essentially similar to those introduced by 
Weierstrass into nineteenth-century analysis. Euclid then passes 
on to a kind of geometrical algebra, and deals, in Book X, with the 
subject of irrationals. After this he proceeds to solid geometry, 
ending with the construction of the regular solids, which had 
been perfected by Theaetetus and assumed in Plato's Timaeus. 

Euclid's _Elements_ is certainly one of the greatest books ever 
written, and one of the most perfect monuments of the Greek 
intellect. It has, of course, the typical Greek limitations: the 
method is purely deductive, and there is no way, within it, of 
testing the initial assumptions. These assumptions were supposed 
to be unquestionable, but in the nineteenth century non-Euclidean 
geometry showed that they might be in part mistaken, and that 
only observation could decide whether they were so. 

There is in Euclid the contempt for practical utility which had been
inculcated by Plato. It is said that a pupil, after listening to a
demonstration, asked what he would gain by learning geometry,
whereupon Euclid called a slave and said "Give the young man
threepence, since he must needs make a gain out of what he learns."
The contempt for practice was, however, pragmatically justified. No
one, in Greek times, supposed that conic sections had any utility; at
last, in the seventeenth century, Galileo discovered that projectiles
move in parabolas, and Kepler discovered that planets move in
ellipses. Suddenly the work that the Greeks had done from pure love of
theory became the key to warfare and astronomy.

The Romans were too practical-minded to appreciate Euclid; the first
of them to mention him is Cicero, in whose time there was probably no
Latin translation; indeed there is no record of any Latin translation
before Boethius (_ca_. AD 480). The Arabs were more appreciative: a
copy was given to the caliph by the Byzantine emperor about AD 760,
and a translation into Arabic was made under Harun al Rashid, about
AD 800. The first still extant Latin translation was made from the
Arabic by Adelard of Bath in AD 1120. From that time on, the study of
geometry gradually revived in the West; but it was not until the late
Renaissance that important advances were made.

I come now to astronomy, where Greek achievements were as remarkable
as in geometry. Before their time, among the Babylonians and
Egyptians, many centuries of observation had laid a foundation. The
apparent motions of the planets had been recorded, but it was not
known that the morning and evening star were the same. A cycle of
eclipses had been discovered, certainly in Babylonia and probably in
Egypt, which made the prediction of lunar eclipses fairly reliable,
but not of solar eclipses, since those were not always visible at a
given spot. We owe to the Babylonians the division of the right angle
into ninety degrees, and of the degree into sixty minutes; they had a
liking for the number sixty, and even a system of numeration based
upon it. The Greeks were fond of attributing the wisdom of their
pioneers to travels in Egypt, but what had really been achieved before
the Greeks was very little. The prediction of an eclipse by Thales
was, however, an example of foreign influence; there is no reason to
suppose that he added anything to what he learnt from Egyptian or
Babylonian sources, and it was a stroke of luck that his prediction
was verified.

Let us begin with some of the earliest discoveries and correct 
hypotheses. Anaximander thought that the earth floats freely, and 
is not supported on anything. Aristotle,[^75] who often rejected the 
best hypotheses of his time, objected to the theory of Anaximander, that the earth, being at the center, remained immovable 
because there was no reason for moving in one direction rather 
than another. If this were valid, he said, a man placed at the 
center of a circle with food at various points of the circumference 
would starve to death for lack of reason to choose one portion of 
food rather than another. This argument reappears in scholastic 
philosophy, not in connection with astronomy, but with free will. 
It reappears in the form of "Buridan's ass," which was unable to 
choose between two bundles of hay placed at equal distances to 
right and left, and therefore died of hunger. 

[^75]: _De Caelo_, 295. 


Pythagoras, in all probability, was the first to think the earth
spherical, but his reasons were (one must suppose) aesthetic rather
than scientific. Scientific reasons, however, were soon found.
Anaxagoras discovered that the moon shines by reflected light, and
gave the right theory of eclipses. He himself still thought the earth
flat, but the shape of the earth's shadow in lunar eclipses gave the
Pythagoreans conclusive arguments in favor of its being spherical.
They went further, and regarded the earth as one of the planets. They
knew from Pythagoras himself, it is said that the morning star and the
evening star are identical, and they thought that ail the planets,
including the earth, move in circles, not round the sun, but round the
"central fire." They had discovered that the moon always turns the
same face to the earth, and they thought that the earth always turns
the same face to the "central fire." The Mediterranean regions were on
the side turned away from the central fire, which was therefore always
invisible. The central fire was called "the house of Zeus," or "the
Mother of the gods." The sun was supposed to shine by light reflected
from the central fire. In addition to the earth, there was another
body, the counter-earth, at the same distance from the central fire.
For this, they had two reasons, one scientific, one derived from their
arithmetical mysticism. The scientific reason was the correct
observation that an eclipse of the moon sometimes occurs when both sun
and moon are above the horizon. Refraction, which is the cause of this
phenomenon, was unknown to them, and they thought that, in such cases,
the eclipse must be due to the shadow of a body other than the earth.
The other reason was that the sun and moon, the five planets, the
earth and counter-earth, and the central fire, made ten heavenly
bodies, and ten was the mystic number of the Pythagoreans.

This Pythagorean theory is attributed to Philolatis, a Theban, who
lived at the end of the fifth century BC. Although it is fanciful and
in part quite unscientific, it is very important, since it involves
the greater part of the imaginative effort required for conceiving the
Copernican hypothesis. To conceive of the earth, not as the center of
the universe, but as one among the planets, not as eternally fixed,
but as wandering through space, showed an extraordinary emancipation
from anthropoctntric thinking. When once this jolt had been given to
men's natural picture of the universe, it was not so very difficult to
be led by scientific arguments to a more accurate theory.

To this various observations contributed. Oenopides, who was slightly
later than Anaxagoras, discovered the obliquity of the ecliptic. It
soon became clear that the sun must be much larger than the earth,
which fact supported those who denied that the earth is the center of
the universe. The central fire and the counter-earth were dropped by
the Pythagoreans soon after the time of Plato. Heraclides of Pontus
(whose dates are about 388 to 315 BC, contemporary with Aristotle)
discovered that Venus and Mercury revolve about the sun, and adopted
the view that the earth rotates on its own axis once every twenty-four
hours. This last was a very important step, which no predecessor had
taken. Heraclides was of Plato's school, and must have been a great
man, but was not as much respected as one would expect; he is
described as a fat dandy.

Aristarchus of Samos, who lived approximately from 310 to 230 BC, and
was thus about twenty-five years older than Archimedes, is the most
interesting of all ancient astronomers, because he advanced the
complete Copernican hypothesis, that all the planets, including the
earth, revolve in circles round the sun, and that the earth rotates on
its axis once in twenty-four hours. It is a little disappointing to
find that the only extant work of Aristarchus, _On the Sizes and
Distances of the Sun and the Moon_, adheres to the geocentric view. It
is true that, for the problems with which this book deals, it makes no
difference which theory is adopted, and he may therefore have thought
it unwise to burden his calculations with an unnecessary opposition to
the general opinion of astronomers; or he may have only arrived at the
Copernican hypothesis after writing this book. Sir Thomas Heath, in
his work on Aristarchus,[^76] which contains the text of this book
with a translation, inclines to the latter view. The evidence that
Aristarchus suggested the Copernican view is, in any case, quite
conclusive.

[^76]: _Aristarchus of Samos, the Ancient Copernicus_. By Sir Thomas Heath. Oxford, 1913. What follows is based on this book. 


The first and best evidence is that of Archimedes, who, as we have
seen, was a younger contemporary of Aristarchus. Writing to Gelon,
King of Syracuse, he says that Aristarchus brought out "a book
consisting of certain hypotheses," and continues: "His hypotheses are
that the fixed stars and the sun remain unmoved, that the earth
revolves about the sun in the circumference of a circle, the sun lying
in the middle of the orbit." There is a passage in Plutarch saying
that Cleanthes "thought it was the duty of the Greeks to indict
Aristarchus of Samos on the charge of impiety for putting in motion
the Hearth of the Universe (i.e. the earth), this being the effect of
his attempt to save the phenomena by supposing the heaven to remain at
rest and the earth to revolve in an oblique circle, while it rotates,
at the same time, about its own axis." Cleanthes was a contemporary of
Aristarchus, and died about 232 BC. In another passage, Plutarch says
that Aristarchus advanced this view only as a hypothesis, but that his
successor Seleucus maintained it as a definite opinion. (Seleucus
flourished about 250 BC). Aetius and Sextus Empiricus also assert that
Aristarchus advanced the heliocentric hypothesis, but do not say that
it was set forth by him only as a hypothesis. Even if he did so, it
seems not unlikely that he, like Galileo two thousand years later, was
influenced by the fear of offending religious prejudices, a fear which
the attitude of Cleanthes (mentioned above) shows to have been well
grounded.

The Copernican hypothesis, after being advanced, whether positively or
tentatively, by Aristarchus, was definitely adopted by Seleucus, but
by no other ancient astronomer. This general rejection was mainly due
to Hipparchus, who flourished from 161 to 126 BC. He is described by
Heath as "the greatest astronomer of antiquity."[^77] He was the first
to write systematically on trigonometry; he discovered the precession
of the equinoxes; he estimated the length of the lunar month with an
error of less than one second; he improved Aristarchus's estimates of
the sizes and distances of the sun and moon; he made a catalogue of
eight hundred and fifty fixed stars, giving their latitude and
longitude. As against the heliocentric hypothesis of Aristarchus, he
adopted and improved the theory of epicycles which had been invented
by Apollonius, who flourished about 220 BC; it was a development of
this theory that came to be known, later, as the Ptolemaic system,
after the astronomer Ptolemy, who flourished in the middle of the
second century AD.

[^77]: _Greek Mathematics_, Vol. II, p. 253. 


Copernicus perhaps came to know something, though not much, of the
almost forgotten hypothesis of Aristarchus, and was encouraged by
finding ancient authority for his innovation. Otherwise, the effect of
this hypothesis on subsequent astronomy was practically nil.

Ancient astronomers, in estimating the sizes of the earth, moon, 
and sun, and the distances of the moon and sun, used methods 
which were theoretically valid, but they were hampered by the 
lack of instruments of precision. Many of their results, in view 
of this lack, were surprisingly good. Eratosthenes estimated the 
earth's diameter at 7,850 miles, which is only about fifty miles 
short of the truth. Ptolemy estimated the mean distance of the 
moon at 29 1/2 times the earth's diameter; the correct figure is 
about 30.2. None of them got anywhere near the size and distance 
of the sun, which all under-estimated. Their estimates, in terms 
of the earth's diameter, were: 

> Aristarchus, 180;  
> Hipparchus, 1,245;  
> Posidonius, 6,545.  

The correct figure is 11,726. It will be seen that these estimates
continually improved (that of Ptolemy, however, showed a
retrogression); that of Posidonius[^78] is about half the correct
figure. On the whole, their picture of the solar system was not so
very far from the truth.

[^78]: Posidonius was Cicero's teacher. He flourished in the latter half of the second century BC.

Greek astronomy was geometrical, not dynamic. The ancients thought of
the motions of the heavenly bodies as uniform and circular, or
compounded of circular motions. They had not the conception of force.
There were spheres which moved as a whole, and on which the various
heavenly bodies were fixed. With Newton and gravitation a new point of
view, less geometrical, was introduced. It is curious to observe that
there is a reversion to the geometrical point of view in Einstein's
General Theory of Relativity, from which the conception of force, in
the Newtonian sense, has been banished.

The problem for the astronomer is this: given the apparent motions of
the heavenly bodies on the celestial sphere, to introduce, by
hypothesis, a third co-ordinate, depth, in such a way as to make the
description of the phenomena as simple as possible. The merit of the
Coperntcan hypothesis is not truth, but simplicity; in view of the
relativity of motion, no question of truth is involved. The Greeks, in
their search for hypotheses which would "save the phenomena," were in
effect, though not altogether in intention, tackling the problem in
the scientifically correct way. A comparison with their predecessors,
and with their successors until Copernicus, must convince every
student of their truly astonishing genius.

Two very great men, Archimedes and Apollonius, in the third 
century BC, complete the list of first-class Greek mathematicians. 
Archimedes was a friend, probably a cousin, of the king of 
Syracuse, and was killed when that city was captured by the 
Romans in 212 BC Apollonius, from his youth, lived at Alexandria. 
Archimedes was not only a mathematician, but also a physicist 
and student of hydrostatics. Apollonius is chiefly noted for his 
work on conic sections. I shall say no more about them, as they 
came too late to influence philosophy. 

After these two men, though respectable work continued to be done in
Alexandria, the great age was ended. Under the Roman domination, the
Greeks lost the self-confidence that belongs to political liberty, and
in losing it acquired a paralyzing respect for their predecessors. The
Roman soldier who killed Archimedes was a symbol of the death of
original thought that Rome caused throughout the Hellenic world.

# Part 3. Ancient Philosophy after Aristotle 

## Chapter XXV THE HELLENISTIC WORLD 

The history of the Greek-speaking world in antiquity may be divided
into three periods: that of the free City States, which was brought to
an end by Philip and Alexander; that of the Macedonian domination, of
which the last remnant was extinguished by the Roman annexation of
Egypt after the death of Cleopatra; and finally that of the Roman
Empire. Of these three periods, the first is characterized by freedom
and disorder, and second by subjection and disorder, the third by
subjection and order.

The second of these periods is known as the Hellenistic age. In
science and mathematics, the work done during this period is the best
ever achieved by the Greeks. In philosophy, it includes the foundation
of the Epicurean and Stoic schools, and also of skepticism as a
definitely formulated doctrine; it is therefore still important
philosophically, though less so than the period of Plato and
Aristotle. After the third century BC, there is nothing really new in
Greek philosophy until the Neoplatonists in the third century AD. But
meanwhile the Roman world was being prepared for the victory of
Christianity.

The brief career of Alexander suddenly transformed the Greek world. In
the ten years from 334 to 324 BC, he conquered Asia Minor, Syria,
Egypt, Babylonia, Persia, Samarcand, Bactria, and the Punjab. The
Persian Empire, the greatest that the world had known, was destroyed
by three battles. The ancient lore of the Babylonians, along with
their ancient superstitions, became familiar to Greek curiosity; so
did the Zoroastrian dualism and (in a lesser degree) die religions of
India, where Buddhism was moving towards supremacy. Wherever Alexander
penetrated, even in the mountains of Afghanistan, on the banks of the
Jaxattes, and on the tributaries of the Indus, he founded Greek
cities, in which he tried to reproduce Greek institutions, with a
measure of self-government. Although his army was composed mainly of
Macedonians, and although most European Greeks submitted to him
unwillingly, he considered himself, at first, as the apostle of
Hellenism. Gradually, however, as his conquests extended, he adopted
the policy of promoting a friendly fusion between Greek and barbarian.

For this he had various motives. On the one hand, it was obvious that
his armies, which were not very large, could not permanently hold so
vast an empire by force, but must, in the long run, depend upon
conciliation of the conquered populations. On the other hand, the East
was unaccustomed to any form of government except that of a divine
king, a role which Alexander felt himself well fitted to perform.
Whether he believed himself a god, or only took on the attributes of
divinity from motives of policy, is a question for the psychologist,
since the historical evidence is indecisive. In any case, he clearly
enjoyed the adulation which he received in Egypt as successor of the
Pharaohs, and in Persia as the Great King. His Macedonian captains the
"Companions," as they were called had towards him the attitude of
western nobles to their constitutional sovereign: they refused to
prostrate themselves before him, they gave advice and criticism even
at the risk of their lives, and at a crucial moment they controlled
his actions, when they compelled him to turn homewards from the Indus
instead of marching on to the conquest of the Ganges. Orientals were
more accommodating, provided their religious prejudices were
respected. This offered no difficulty to Alexander; it was only
necessary to identify Ammon or Bel with Zeus, and to declare himself
the son of the god. Psychologists observe that Alexander hated Philip,
and was probably privy to his murder; he would have liked to believe
that his mother Olympias, like some lady of Greek mythology, had been
beloved of a god. Alexander's career was so miraculous that he may
well have thought a miraculous origin the best explanation of his
prodigious success.

The Greeks had a very strong feeling of superiority to the barbarians;
Aristotle no doubt expresses the general view when he says that
northern races are spirited, southern races civilized, but the Greeks
alone are both spirited and civilized. Plato and Aristotle thought it
wrong to make slaves of Greeks, but not of barbarians. Alexander, who
was not quite a Greek, tried to break down this attitude of
superiority. He himself married two barbarian princesses, and he
compelled his leading Macedonians to marry Persian women of noble
birth. His innumerable Greek cities, one would suppose, must have
contained many more male than female colonists, and their men must
therefore have followed his example in intermarrying with the women of
the locality. The result of this policy was to bring into the minds of
thoughtful men the conception of mankind as a whole; the old loyalty
to the City State and (in a lesser degree) to the Greek race seemed no
longer adequate. In philosophy, this cosmopolitan point of view begins
with the Stoics, but in practice it begins earlier, with Alexander. It
had the result that the interaction of Greek and barbarian was
reciprocal: the barbarians learnt something of Greek science, while
the Greeks learnt much of barbarian superstition. Greek civilization,
in covering a wider area, became less purely Greek.

Greek civilization was essentially urban. There were, of course, many
Greeks engaged in agriculture, but they contributed little to what was
distinctive in Hellenic culture. From the Milesian school onwards, the
Greeks who were eminent in science and philosophy and literature were
associated with rich commercial cities, often surrounded by barbarian
populations. This type of civilization was inaugurated, not by the
Greeks, but by the Phoenicians; Tyre and Sidon and Carthage depended
on slaves for manual labour at home, and on hired mercenaries in the
conduct of their wars. They did not depend, as modern capital cities
do, upon large rural populations of the same blood and with equal
political rights. The nearest modern analogue is to be seen in the Far
East during the latter half of the nineteenth century. Singapore and
Hong Kong, Shanghai and the other treaty ports of China, were little
European islands, where the white men formed a commercial
aristocracy living on coolie labour. In North America, north of the
Mason-Dixon line, since such labour was not available, white men were
compelled to practice agriculture. For this reason, the hold of the
white man on North America is secure, while his hold on the Far East
has already been greatly diminished, and may easily cease altogether.
Much of his type of culture, especially industrialism, will, however,
survive. This analogue will help us to understand the position of the
Greeks in the Alexander's empire.

The effect of Alexander on the imagination of Asia was great 
and lasting. The _First Book of the Maccabees_, written centuries 
after his death, opens with an account of his career: 

> And it happened, after that Alexander, son of Philip, the
> Macedonian, who came out of the land of Chettiim, had smitten
> Darius, king of the Persians and Medes, that he reigned in his
> stead, the first over Greece, and made many wars, and won many
> strong holds, and slew the kings of the earth, and went through to
> the ends of the earth, and took spoil of many nations, insomuch that
> the earth was quiet before him; whereupon he was exalted, and his
> heart was lifted up. And he gathered a mighty strong host, and ruled
> over countries, and nations, and kings, who became tributaries unto
> him. And after these things he fell sick, and perceived that he
> should die. Wherefore he called his servants, such as were
> honorable, and had been brought up with him from his youth, and
> parted his kingdom among them, while he was yet alive.[^79] So
> Alexander reigned twelve years, and then died.

[^79]: This is not historically true. 

He survived as a legendary hero in the Mohammedan religion, 
and to this day petty chieftains in the Himalayas claim to be 
descended from him.[^80] No other fully historical hero has ever 
furnished such a perfect opportunity for the mythopoeic faculty. 

[^80]: Perhaps this is no longer true, as the sons of those who held this belief have been educated at Eton. 

At Alexander's death, there was an attempt to preserve the unity of
his empire. But of his two sons, one was an infant and the other was
not yet born. Each had supporters, but in the resultant civil war both
were thrust aside. In the end, his empire was divided between the
families of three generals, of whom, roughly speaking, one obtained
the European, one the African, and one the Asiatic parts of
Alexander's possessions. The European part fell ultimately to
Antigonus's descendants; Ptolemy, who obtained Egypt, made Alexandria
his capital; Seleucus, who obtained Asia after many wars, was too busy
with campaigns to have a fixed capital, but in later times Antioch was
the chief city of his dynasty.

Both the Ptolemies and the Seleucids (as the dynasty of Seleucus was
called) abandoned Alexander's attempts to produce a fusion of Greek
and barbarian, and established military tyrannies based, at first,
upon their part of the Macedonian army strengthened with Greek
mercenaries. The Ptolemies held Egypt fairly securely, but in Asia two
centuries of confused dynastic wars were only ended by the Roman
conquest. During these centuries, Persia was conquered by the
Parthians, and the Bactrian Greeks were increasingly isolated.

In the second century BC (after which they rapidly declined) 
they had a king, Menander, whose Indian Empire was very 
extensive. A couple of dialogues between him and a Buddhist sage 
have survived in Pali, and, in part, in a Chinese translation. Dr. 
Tarn suggests that the first of these is based on a Greek original; 
the second, which ends with Menander abdicating and becoming 
a Buddhist saint, is certainly not. 

Buddhism, at this time, was a vigorous proselytizing religion. 
Asoka (264-228), the saintly Buddhist king, records, in a still extant 
inscription, that he sent missionaries to all the Macedonian kings: 
"And this is the chiefest conquest in His Majesty's opinion the 
conquest by the Law; this also is that effected by His Majesty both 
in his own dominions and in all the neighboring realms as far 
as six hundred leagues even to where the Greek king Antiochus 
dwells, and beyond that Antiochus to where dwell the four kings 
severally named Ptolemy, Antigonus, Magas, and Alexander... 
and likewise here, in the king's dominions, among the Yonas"[^81] 
(i.e. the Greeks of the Punjab). Unfortunately no western account 
of these missionaries has survived. 

[^81]: Quoted in Bevan, _House of Seleucus_, Vol. I, p. 2980. 

Babylonia was much more profoundly influenced by Hellenism. As we have
seen, the only ancient who followed Aristarchus of Samos in
maintaining the Copernican system was Seleucus of Seleucia on the
Tigris, who flourished about 150 BC Tacitus tells us that in the first
century AD Seleucia had not "lapsed into the barbarous usages of the
Parthians, but still retained the institutions of Seleucus,[^82] its
Greek founder. Three hundred citizens, chosen for their wealth or
wisdom, compose as it were a Senate; the populace too have their share
of power."[^83] Throughout Mesopotamia, as further West, Greek became
the language of literature and culture, and remained so until the
Mohammedan conquest.

[^83]: _Annals_, Book VI, chap. 42. 

Syria (excluding Judea) became completely Hellenized in the 
cities, in so far as language and literature were concerned. But the 
rural populations, which were more conservative, retained the 
religions and the languages to which they were accustomed.[^84] In 
Asia Minor, the Greek cities of the coast had, for centuries, had 
an influence on their barbarian neighbors. This was intensified 
by the Macedonian conquest. The first conflict of Hellenism with 
the Jews is related in the Books of the Maccabees. It is a profoundly 
interesting story, unlike anything else in the Macedonian Empire. 
I shall deal with it at a later stage, when I come to the origin and 
growth of Christianity. Elsewhere, Greek influence encountered 
no such stubborn opposition. 

[^84]: See _Cambridge Ancient History_, Vol. V1I, pp. 194-5. 

From the point of view of Hellenistic culture, the most brilliant 
success of the third century BC was the city of Alexandria. Egypt 
was less exposed to war than the European and Asiatic parts of 
the Macedonian domain, and Alexandria was in an extraordinarily 
favored position for commerce. The Ptolemies were patrons of 
learning, and attracted to their capital many of the best men of 
the age. Mathematics became, and remained until the fall of Rome, 
mainly Alexandrian. Archimedes, it is true, was a Sicilian, and 
belonged to the one part of the world where the Greek City 
States (until the moment of his death in 212 BC) retained their 
independence; but he too had studied in Alexandria. Eratosthenes 
was chief librarian of the famous library of Alexandria. The 
mathematicians and men of science connected, more or less closely, 
with Alexandria in the third century before Christ were as able 
as any of the Greeks of the previous centuries, and did work of 
equal importance. But they were not, like their predecessors, men 
who took all learning for their province, and propounded universal 
philosophies; they were specialists in the modern sense. Euclid, 
Aristarchus, Archimedes, and Apollonius, were content to be 
mathematicians; in philosophy they did not aspire to originality. 

Specialization characterized the age in all departments, not only 
in the world of learning. In the self-governing Greek cities of the 
fifth and fourth centuries, a capable man was assumed to be capable 
of everything. He would be, as occasion arose, a soldier, a politician, 
a lawgiver, or a philosopher. Socrates, though he disliked politics, 
could not avoid being mixed up with political disputes. In his 
youth he was a soldier, and (in spite of his disclaimer in the 
_Apology_) a student of physical science. Protagoras, when he could 
spare time from teaching skepticism to aristocratic youths in search 
of the latest thing, was drawing up a code of laws for Thurii. 

Plato dabbled in politics, though unsuccessfully. Xenophon, when he
was neither writing about Socrates nor being a country gentleman,
spent his spare time as a general. Pythagorean mathematicians
attempted to acquire the government of cities. Everybody had to serve
on juries and perform various other public duties. In the third
century all this was changed. There continued, it is true, to be
politics in the old City States, but they had become parochial and
unimportant, since Greece was at the mercy of Macedonian armies. The
serious struggles for power were between Macedonian soldiers; they
involved no question of principle, but merely the distribution of
territory between rival adventurers. On administrative and technical
matters, these more or less uneducated soldiers employed Greeks as
experts; in Egypt, for example, excellent work was done in irrigation
and drainage. There were soldiers, administrators, physicians,
mathematicians, philosophers, but there was no one who was all these
at once.

The age was one in which a man who had money and no desire 
for power could enjoy a very pleasant life always assuming that 
no marauding army happened to come his way. Learned men who 
found favor with some prince could enjoy a high degree of luxury, 
provided they were adroit flatterers and did not mind being the 
butt of ignorant royal witticisms. But there was no such thing as 
security. A palace revolution might displace the sycophantic 
sage's patron; the Galatians might destroy the rich man's villa; 
one's city might be sacked as an incident in a dynastic war. In 
such circumstances it is no wonder that people took to worshipping 
the goddess Fortune, or Luck. There seemed nothing rational in 
the ordering of human affairs. Those who obstinately insisted 
upon finding rationality somewhere withdrew into themselves, 
and decided, like Milton's Satan, that 

> The mind is its own place, and in itself  
> Can make a heaven of hell, a hell of heaven.  

Except for adventurous self-seekers, there was no longer any incentive
to take an interest in public affairs. After the brilliant episode of
Alexander's conquests, the Hellenistic world was sinking into chaos,
for lack of a despot strong enough to achieve stable supremacy, or a
principle powerful enough to produce social cohesion. Greek
intelligence, confronted with new political problems, showed complete
incompetence. The Romans, no doubt, were stupid and brutal compared to
the Greeks, but at least they created order. The old disorder of the
days of freedom had been tolerable, because every citizen had a share
in it; but the new Macedonian disorder, imposed upon subjects by
incompetent rulers, was utterly intolerable far more so than the
subsequent subjection to Rome.

There was widespread social discontent and fear of revolution. The
wages of free labour fell, presumably owing to the competition of
eastern slave labour; and meantime the prices of necessaries rose. One
finds Alexander, at the outset of his enterprise, having time to make
treaties designed to keep the poor in their place. "In the treaties
made in 335 between Alexander and the States of the League of Corinth
it was provided that the Council of the League and Alexander's
representative were to see to it that in no city of the League should
there be either confiscation of personal property, or division of
land, or cancellation of debt, or liberation of slaves for the purpose
of revolution."[^85] The temples, in the Hellenistic world, were the
bankers; they owned the gold reserve, and controlled credit. In the
early third century, the temple of Apollo at Delos made loans at ten
per cent; formerly, the rate of interest had been higher.[^86]

[^85]: "The Social Question in the Third Century," by W W. Tarn, in _The Hellenistic Age_ by various authors. Cambridge, 1923. This essay is exceedingly interesting, and contains many facts nor elsewhere readily accessible. 

[^86]: _Ibid_. 

Free labourers who found wages insufficient even for bare necessities
must, if young and vigorous, have been able to obtain employment as
mercenaries. The life of a mercenary, no doubt, was filled with
hardships and dangers, but it also had great possibilities. There
might be the loot of some rich eastern city; there might be a chance
of lucrative mutiny. It must have been dangerous for a commander to
attempt to disband his army, and this must have been one of the
reasons why wars were almost continuous.

The old civic spirit more or less survived in the old Greek cities,
but not in the new cities founded by Alexander not excepting
Alexandria. In earlier times, a new city was always a colony composed
of emigrants from some one older city, and it remained connected with
its parent by a bond of sentiment. This kind of sentiment had great
longevity, as is shown, for example, by the diplomatic activities of
Lampsacus on the Hellespont in the year 196 BC. This city was
threatened with subjugation by the Seleucid King Antiochus III, and
decided to appeal to Rome for protection. An embassy was sent, but it
did not go direct to Rome; it went first, in spite of the immense
distance, to Marseilles, which, like Lampsacus, was a colony of
Phocaea, and was, moreover, viewed with friendly eyes by the Romans.
The citizens of Marseilles, having listened to an oration by the
envoy, at once decided to send a diplomatic mission of their own to
Rome to support their sister city. The Gauls who lived inland from
Marseilles joined in with a letter to their kinsmen of Asia Minor, the
Galatians, recommending Lampsacus to their friendship. Rome,
naturally, was glad of a pretext for meddling in the affairs of Asia
Minor, and by Rome's intervention Lampsacus preserved its freedom
until it became inconvenient to the Romans.[^87]

[^87]: Beyan, _House of Seleucus_, Vol. II, pp. 45-6. 

In general, the rulers of Asia called themselves "Phil-Hellene," and
befriended the old Greek cities as far as policy and military
necessity allowed. The cities desired, and (when they could) claimed
as a right, democratic self-government, absence of tribute, and
freedom from a royal garrison. It was worth while to conciliate them,
because they were rich, they could supply mercenaries, and many of
them had important harbors. But if they took the wrong side in a
civil war, they exposed themselves to sheer conquest. On the whole,
the Seleucids, and the other dynasties which gradually grew up, dealt
tolerably with them, but there were exceptions.

The new cities, though they had a measure of self-government, had not
the same traditions as the older ones. Their citizens were not of
homogeneous origin, but were from all parts of Greece. They were in
the main adventurers like the conquistadors or the settlers in
Johannesburg, not pious pilgrims like the earlier Greek colonists or
the New England pioneers. Consequently no one of Alexander's cities
formed a strong political unit. This was convenient from the
standpoint of the king's government, but a weakness from the
standpoint of the spread of Hellenism.

The influence of non-Greek religion and superstition in the
Hellenistic world was mainly, but not wholly, bad. This might not have
been the case. Jews, Persians, and Buddhists all had religions that
were very definitely superior to the popular Greek polytheism, and
could even have been studied with profit by the best philosophers.
Unfortunately it was the Babylonians, or Chaldeans, who most impressed
the imagination of the Greeks. There was, first of all, their fabulous
antiquity; the priestly records went back for thousands of years, and
professed to go back for thousands more. Then there was some genuine
wisdom: the Babylonians could more or less predict eclipses long
before the Greeks could. But these were merely causes of
receptiveness; what was received was mainly astrology and magic.
"Astrology," says Professor Gilbert Murray, "fell upon the Hellenistic
mind as a new disease falls upon some remote island people. The tomb
of Ozymandias, as described by Diodorus, was covered with astrological
symbols, and that of Antiochus I, which has been discovered in
Commagene, is of the same character. It was natural for monarchs to
believe that the stars watched over them. But every one was ready to
receive the germ."[^88] It appears that astrology was first taught to
the Greeks in the time of Alexander, by a Chaldean named Berosus, who
taught in Cos, and, according to Seneca, "interpreted Bel." "This,"
says Professor Murray, "must mean that he translated into Greek the
'Eye of Bel,' a treatise in seventy tablets found in the library of
Assur-bani-pal (686-626 BC) but composed for Sargon I in the third
millennium BC" (_ibid_., p. 176).

[^88]: _Five Stages of Greek Religion_ pp. 177--8 

As we shall see, the majority even of the best philosophers fell 
in with the belief in astrology. It involved, since it thought the 
future predictable, a belief in necessity or fate, which could be 
set against the prevalent belief in fortune. No doubt most men 
believed in both, and never noticed the inconsistency. 

The general confusion was bound to bring moral decay, even more than
intellectual enfeeblement. Ages of prolonged uncertainty, while they
are compatible with the highest degree of saintliness in a few, are
inimical to the prosaic every-day virtues of respectable citizens.
There seems no use in thrift, when to-morrow all your savings may be
dissipated; no advantage in honesty, when the man towards whom you
practice it is pretty sure to swindle you; no point in steadfast
adherence to a cause, when no cause is important or has a chance of
stable victory; no argument in favor of truthfulness, when only
supple tergiversation makes the preservation of life and fortune
possible. The man whose virtue has no source except a purely
terrestrial prudence will, in such a world, become an adventurer if he
has the courage, and, if not, will seek obscurity as a timid
time-server.

Menander, who belongs to this age, says: 

> So many cases I have known  
> Of men who, though not naturally rogues,  
> Became so, through misfortune, by constraint.  

This sums up the moral character of the third century BC, 
except for a few exceptional men. Even among these few, fear 
took the place of hope; the purpose of life was rather to escape 
misfortune than to achieve any positive good. "Metaphysics sink 
into the background, and ethics, now individual, become of the 
first importance. Philosophy is no longer the pillar of fire going 
before a few intrepid seekers after truth: it is rather an ambulance 
following in the wake of the struggle for existence and picking up 
the weak and wounded."[^89] 

[^89]: C.F. Angus in _Cambridge Ancient History_, Vol. VII, p. 231. The above quotation from Menander is taken from the same chapter. 

## Chapter XXVI CYNICS AND SKEPTICS 

The relation of intellectually eminent men to contemporary society has
been very different in different ages. In some fortunate epochs they
have been on the whole in harmony with their surroundings suggesting,
no doubt, such reforms as seemed to them necessary, but fairly
confident that their suggestions would be welcomed, and not disliking
the world in which they found themselves even if it remained
unreformed. At other times they have been revolutionary, considering
that radical alterations were called for, but expecting that, partly
as a result of their advocacy, these alterations would be brought
about in the near future. At yet other times they have despaired of
the world, and felt that, though they themselves knew what was needed,
there was no hope of its being brought about. This mood sinks easily
into the deeper despair which regards life on earth as essentially
bad, and hopes for good only in a future life or in some mystical
transfiguration.

In some ages, all these attitudes have been adopted by different 
men living at the same time. Consider, for example, the early 
nineteenth century. Goethe is comfortable, Bentham is a reformer, 
Shelley is a revolutionary, and Leopardi is a pessimist. But in 
most periods there has been a prevailing tone among great writers. 
In England they were comfortable under Elizabeth and in the 
eighteenth century; in France, they became revolutionary about 
1750; in Germany, they have been nationalistic since 1813. 

During the period of ecclesiastical domination, from the fifth 
century to the fifteenth, there was a certain conflict between what 
was theoretically believed and what was actually felt. Theoretically, 
the world was a vale of tears, a preparation, amid tribulation, for 
the world to come. But in practice the writers of books, being 
almost all clerics, could not help feeling exhilarated by the power 
of the Church; they found opportunity for abundant activity of 
a sort that they believed to be useful. They had therefore the 
mentality of a governing class, not of men who feel themselves 
exiles in an alien world. This is part of the curious dualism that 
runs through the Middle Ages, owing to the fact that the Church, 
though based on other-worldly beliefs, was the most important 
institution in the every-day world. 

The psychological preparation for the other-worldliness of
Christianity begins in the Hellenistic period, and is connected with
the eclipse of the City State. Down to Aristotle, Greek philosophers,
though they might complain of this or that, were, in the main, not
cosmically despairing, nor did they feel themselves politically
impotent. They might, at times, belong to a beaten party, but, if so,
their defeat was due to the chances of conflict, not to any inevitable
powerlessness of the wise. Even those who, like Pythagoras, and Plato
in certain moods, condemned the world of appearance and sought escape
in mysticism, had practical plans for turning the governing classes
into saints and sages. When political power passed into the hands of
the Macedonians, Greek philosophers, as was natural, turned aside from
politics and devoted themselves more to the problem of individual
virtue or salvation. They no longer asked: how can men create a good
State? They asked instead: how can men be virtuous in a wicked world,
or happy in a world of suffering? The change, it is true, is only one
of degree; such questions had been asked before, and the later Stoics,
for a time, again concerned themselves with politics the politic^ of
Rome, not of Greece. But the change was none the less real. Except to
a limited extent during the Roman period in Stoicism, the outlook of
those who thought and felt seriously became increasingly subjective
and individualistic, until, at last, Christianity evolved a gospel of
individual salvation which inspired missionary zeal and created the
Church. Until that happened, there was no institution to which the
philosopher could give whole-hearted adherence, and therefore there
was no adequate outlet for his legitimate love of power. For this
reason, the philosophers of the Hellenistic period are more limited as
human beings than the men who lived while the City State could still
inspire allegiance. They still think, because they cannot help
thinking; but they scarcely hope that their thought will bear fruit in
the world of affairs.

Four schools of philosophy were founded about the time of Alexander.
The two most famous, the Stoics and Epicureans, will be the subjects
of later chapters; in the present chapter we shall be concerned with
the Cynics and Skeptics.

The first of these schools is derived, through its founder Diogenes, from Amisthenes, a disciple of Socrates, about twenty 
years older than Plato. Antisthenes was a remarkable character, 
in some ways rather like Tolstoy. Until after the death of Socrates, 
he lived in the aristocratic circle of his fellow disciples, and 
showed no sign of unorthodoxy. But something whether the 
defeat of Athens, or the death of Socrates, or a distaste for philosophic quibbling caused him, when no longer young, to despise 
the things that he had formerly valued. He would have nothing 
but simple goodness. He associated with working men, and 
dressed as one of them. He took to open-air preaching, in a style 
that the uneducated could understand. All refined philosophy he 
held to be worthless; what could be known, could be known by 
the plain man. He believed in the "return to nature" and carried 
this belief very far. There was to be no government, no private 
property, no marriage, no established religion. His followers, if 
not he himself, condemned slavery. He was not exactly ascetic, 
but he despised luxury and all pursuit of artificial pleasures of 
the senses. "I had rather be mad than delighted" he said.[^90]

The fame of Antisthenes was surpassed by that of his disciple
Diogenes, "a young man from Sinope, on the Euxine, whom he
[Antisthenes] did not take to at first sight; the son of a
disreputable money-changer who had been sent to prison for defacing
the coinage. Antisthenes ordered the lad away, but he paid no
attention; he beat him with his stick, but he never moved. He wanted
'wisdom' and saw that Antisthenes had it to give. His aim in life was
to do as his father had done, to 'deface the coinage' but on a much
larger scale. He would deface all the coinage current in the world.
Every conventional stamp was false. The men stamped as generals and
kings; the things stamped as honor and wisdom and happiness and
riches; all were base metal with lying superscription."[^91]

[^91]: _Ibid._, p. 117.

He decided to live like a dog, and was therefore called a "cynic," 
which means "canine." He rejected all conventions whether of 
religion, of manners, of dress, of housing, of food, or of decency. 
One is told that he lived in a tub, but Gilbert Murray assures us 
that this is a mistake: it was a large pitcher, of the sort used in 
primitive times for burials.[^92] He lived, like an Indian fakir, by 
begging. He proclaimed his brotherhood, not only with the whole 
human race, but also with animals. He was a man about whom 
stories gathered, even in his lifetime. Everyone knows how 
Alexander visited him, and asked if he desired any favor; "only 
to stand out of my light," he replied. 

[^92]: _Ibid._, p. 119.


The teaching of Diogenes was by no means what we now call 
"cynical" quite the contrary. He had an ardent passion for 
"virtue," in comparison with which he held worldly goods of no 
account. He sought virtue and moral freedom in liberation from 
desire: be indifferent to the goods that fortune has to bestow, 
and you will be emancipated from fear. In this respect, his doctrine, 
as we shall see, was taken up by the Stoics, but they did not follow 
him in rejecting the amenities of civilization. He considered that 
Prometheus was justly punished for bringing to man the arts that 
have produced the complication and artificiality of modern life. 
In this he resembled the Taoists and Rousseau and Tolstoy, but 
was more consistent than they were. 

His doctrine, though he was a contemporary of Aristotle, 
belongs in its temper to the Hellenistic age. Aristotle is the last 
Greek philosopher who faces the world cheerfully; after him, all 
have, in one form or another, a philosophy of retreat. The world 
is bad; let us learn to be independent of it. External goods are 
precarious; they are the gift of fortune, not the reward of our own 
efforts. Only subjective goods virtue, or contentment through 
resignation are secure, and these alone, therefore, will be valued 
by the wise man. Diogenes personally was a man full of vigor, 
but his doctrine, like all those of the Hellenistic age, was one to 
appeal to weary men, in whom disappointment had destroyed 
natural zest. And it was certainly not a doctrine calculated to 
promote art or science or statesmanship, or any useful activity 
except one of protest against powerful evil. 

It is interesting to observe what the Cynic teaching became when it
was popularized. In the early part of the third century BC, the cynics
were the fashion, especially in Alexandria. They published little
sermons pointing out how easy it is to do without material
possessions, how happy one can be on simple food, how warm one can
keep in winter without expensive clothes (which might be true in
Egypt!), how silly it is to feel affection for one's native country,
or to mourn when one's children or friends die. "Because my son or my
wife is dead," says Teles, who was one of these popularizing Cynics,
"is that any reason for my neglecting myself, who am still alive, and
ceasing to look after my property?"[^93] At this point, it becomes
difficult to feel any sympathy with the simple life, which has grown
altogether too simple. One wonders who enjoyed these sermons. Was it
the rich, who wished to think the sufferings of the poor imaginary? Or
was it the new poor, who were trying to despise the successful
business man? Or was it sycophants who persuaded themselves that the
charity they accepted was unimportant? Teles says to a rich man: "You
give liberally and I take valiantly from you, neither grovelling nor
demeaning myself basely nor grumbling."[^94] A very convenient
doctrine. Popular Cynicism did not teach abstinence from the good
things of this world, but only a certain indifference to them. In the
case of a borrower, this might take the form of minimizing the
obligation to the lender. One can see how the word "cynic" acquired
its everyday meaning.

[^93]: _The Hellenistic Age_ (Cambridge, 1923), p. 84ff. 
[^94]: _Ibid._, p. 86. 

What was best in the Cynic doctrine passed over into Stoicism, 
which was an altogether more complete and rounded philosophy. 

Skepticism, as a doctrine of the schools, was first proclaimed by
Pyrrho, who was in Alexander's army, and campaigned with it as far as
India. It seems that this gave him a sufficient taste of travel, and
that he spent the rest of his life in his native city, Elis, where he
died in 275 BC. There was not much that was new in his doctrine,
beyond a certain systematizing and formalizing of older doubts.
Skepticism with regard to the senses had troubled Greek philosophers
from a very early stage; the only exceptions were those who, like
Parmenides and Plato, denied the cognitive value of perception, and
made their denial into an opportunity for an intellectual dogmatism.
The Sophists, notably Protagoras and Gorgias, had been led by the
ambiguities and apparent contradictions of sense-perception to a
subjectivism not unlike Hume's. Pyrrho seems (for he very wisely wrote
no books) to have added moral and logical skepticism to skepticism as
to the senses. He is said to have maintained that there could never be
any rational ground for preferring one course of action to another. In
practice, this meant that one conformed to the customs of whatever
country one inhabited. A modern disciple would go to church on Sundays
and perform the correct genuflexions, but without any of the religious
beliefs that are supposed to inspire these actions. Ancient Skeptics
went through the whole pagan ritual, and were even sometimes priests;
their Skepticism assured them that this behavior could not be proved
wrong, and their common sense (which survived their philosophy)
assured them that it was convenient.

Skepticism naturally made an appeal to many unphilosophic minds.
People observed the diversity of schools and the acerbity of their
disputes, and decided that all alike were pretending to knowledge
which was in fact unattainable. Skepticism was a lazy man's
consolation, since it showed the ignorant to be as wise as the reputed
men of learning. To men who, by temperament, required a gospel, it
might seem unsatisfying, but like every doctrine of the Hellenistic
period it recommended itself as an antidote to worry. Why trouble
about the future? It is wholly uncertain. You may as well enjoy the
present; "what's to come is still unsure." For these reasons,
Skepticism enjoyed a considerable popular success.

It should be observed that Skepticism as a philosophy is not 
merely doubt, but what may be called dogmatic doubt. The man 
of science says "I think it is so-and-so, but I am not sure." The 
man of intellectual curiosity says "I don't know how it is, but I 
hope to find out." The philosophical Skeptic says "nobody knows, 
and nobody ever can know." It is this element of dogmatism that 
makes the system vulnerable. Skeptics, of course, deny that they 
assert the impossibility of knowledge dogmatically, but their 
denials are not very convincing. 

Pyrrho's disciple Timon, however, advanced some intellectual 
arguments which, from the standpoint of Greek logic, were very 
hard to answer. The only logic admitted by the Greeks was deductive, and all deduction had to start, like Euclid, from general 
principles regarded as self-evident. Timon denied the possibility 
of finding such principles. Everything, therefore, will have to be 
proved by means of something else, and all argument will be 
either circular or an endless chain hanging from nothing. In either 
case nothing can be proved. This argument, as we can see, cut 
at the root of the Aristotelian philosophy which dominated the 
Middle Ages. 

Some forms of Skepticism which, in our own day, arc advocated by men
who arc by no means wholly skeptical, had not occurred to the Skeptics
of antiquity. They did not doubt phenomena, or question propositions
which, in their opinion, only expressed what we know directly
concerning phenomena. Most of Timon's work is lost, but two surviving
fragments will illustrate this point. One says "The phenomenon is
always valid." The other says: "That honey w sweet I refuse to assert;
that it appears sweet, I fully grant."[^95] A modern Skeptic would
point out that the phenomenon merely occurs, and is not either valid
or invalid; what is valid or invalid must be a statement, and no
statement can be so closely linked to the phenomenon as to be
incapable of falsehood. For the same reason, he would say that the
statement "honey appears sweet" is only highly probable, not
absolutely certain.

[^95]: Quoted by Edwyn Bevan, _Stoics and Skeptics_, p. 126. 

In some respects, the doctrine of Timon was very similar to 
that of Hume. He maintained that something which had never 
been observed atoms, for instance could not be validly inferred; 
but when two phenomena had been frequently observed together, 
one could be inferred fiom the other. 

Timon lived at Athens throughout the later years of his long 
life, and died there in 235 BC With his death, the school of 
Pyrrho, as a school, came to an end, but his doctrines, somewhat 
modified, were taken up, strange as it may seem, by the Academy, 
which represented the Platonic tradition. 

The man who effected this surprising philosophic revolution was
Arcesilaus, a contemporary of Timon, who died as an old man about 240
BC. What most men have taken from Plato is belief in a supersensible
intellectual world and in the superiority of the immortal soul to the
mortal body. But Plato was many-sided, and in some respects could be
regarded as teaching skepticism. The Platonic Socrates professes to
know nothing; we naturally treat this as irony, but it could be taken
seriously. Many of the dialogues reach no positive conclusion, and aim
at leaving the reader in a state of doubt. Some the latter half of the
Parmenide*, for instance might seem to have no purpose except to show
that either side of any question can be maintained with equal
plausibility. The Platonic dialectic could be treated as an end,
rather than a means, and if so treated it lent itself admirably to the
advocacy of Skepticism. This seems to have been the way in which
Arcesilaus interpreted the man whom he still professed to follow. He
had decapitated Plato, but at any rate the torso that remained was
genuine.

The manner in which Arcesilaus taught would have had much 
to commend it, if the young men who learnt from him had been 
able to avoid being paralyzed by it. He maintained no thesis, but 
would refute any thesis set up by a pupil. Sometimes he would 
himself advance two contradictory propositions on successive 
occasions, showing how to argue convincingly in favor of either. 
A pupil sufficiently vigorous to rebel might have learnt dexterity 
and the avoidance of fallacies; in fact, none seem to have learnt 
anything except cleverness and indifference to truth. So great 
was the influence of Arcesilaus that the Academy remained 
skeptical for about two hundred years. 

In the middle of this skeptical period, an amusing incident occurred.
Carneades, a worthy successor of Arcesilaus as head of the Academy,
was one of three philosophers sent by Athens on a diplomatic mission
to Rome in the year 156 BC. He saw no reason why his ambassadorial
dignity should interfere with the main chance, so he announced a
course of lectures in Rome. The young men, who, at that time, were
anxious to ape Greek manners and acquire Greek culture, flocked to
hear him. His first lecture expounded the views of Aristotle and Plato
on justice, and was thoroughly edifying. His second, however, was
concerned in refuting all that he had said in his first, not with a
view to establishing opposite conclusions, but merely to show that
every conclusion is unwarranted. Plato's Socrates had argued that to
inflict injustice was a greater evil to the perpetrator than to suffer
it. Carneadcs, in his second lecture, treated this contention with
scorn. Great States, he pointed out, had become great by unjust
aggressions against their weaker neighbors; in Rome, this could not
well be denied. In a shipwreck, you may save your life at the expense
of some one weaker, and you are a fool if you do not. "Women and
children first," he seems to think, is not a maxim that leads to
personal survival. What would you do if you were flying from a
victorious enemy, you had lost your horse, but you found a wounded
comrade on a horse? If you were sensible, you would drag him off and
seize his horse, whatever justice might ordain. All this not very
edifying argumentation is surprising in a nominal follower of Plato,
but it seems to have pleased the modern-minded Roman youths.

There was one man whom it did not please, and that was the 
Cato, who represented the stern, stiff, stupid, and brutal 
moral code by means of which Rome had defeated Carthage. 
From youth to old age, he lived simply, rose early, practiced 
severe manual labour, ate only coarse food, and never wore a 
gown that cost over a hundred pence. Towards the State he was 
scrupulously honest, avoiding all bribery and plunder. He exacted 
of other Romans all the virtues that he practiced himself, and 
asserted that to accuse and pursue the wicked was the best thing 
an honest man could do. He enforced, as far as he could, the old 
Roman severity of manners: 

> Cato put out of the Senate also, one Manilius, who was in 
> great towardness to have been made Consul the next year following, 
> only because he kissed his wife too lovingly in the day time, and 
> before his daughter: and reproving him for it, he told him, his 
> wife never kissed him, but when it thundered."[^96]

[^96]: North's Plutarch, _Lives_, Marcus Cato. 

When he was in power, he put down luxury and feasting. He 
made his wife suckle not only her own children, but also those of 
his slaves, in order that, having been nourished by the same milk, 
they might love his children. When his slaves were too old to 
work, he sold them remorselessly. He insisted that his slaves 
should always be either working or sleeping. He encouraged his 
slaves to quarrel with each other, for "he could not abide that 
they should be friends." When a slave had committed a grave 
fault, he would call in his other slaves, and induce them to condemn 
the delinquent to death; he would then carry out the sentence 
with his own hands in the presence of the survivors. 

The contrast between Cato and Carneades was very complete: 
the one brutal through a morality that was too strict and too 
traditional, the other ignoble through a morality that was too 
lax and too much infected with the social dissolution of the 
Hellenistic world.

> the Greek tongue, and that it grew in estimation in Rome, did
> dislike of it: fearing lest the youth of Rome that were desirous of

> Senate, not of any private ill will or malice he bare to Carneades,
> as some men thought: but because he generally hated philosophy."[^97]

[^97]: North's Plutarch, _Lives_, Marcus Cato. 

The Athenians, in Cato's view, were a lesser breed without the law; it
did not matter if they were degraded by the shallow sophistries of
intellectuals, but the Roman youth must be kept puritanical,
imperialistic, ruthless, and stupid. He failed, however; later Romans,
while retaining many of his vices, adopted those of Carneades also.

The next head of the Academy, after Carneades (_ca_. 180 to _ca_. 110
BC), was a Carthaginian whose real name was Hasdrubal, but who, in his
dealings with Greeks, preferred to call himself Clitomachus. Unlike
Carneades, who confined himself to lecturing, Clitomachus wrote over
four hundred books, some of them in the Phoenician language. His
principles appear to have been the same as those of Carneades. In some
respects, they were useful. These two Skeptics set themselves against
the belief in divination, magic, and astrology, which was becoming
more and more widespread. They also developed a constructive doctrine,
concerning degrees of probability: although we can never be justified
in feeling certainty, some things are more likely to be true than
others. Probability should be our guide in practice, since it is
reasonable to act on the most probable of possible hypotheses. This
view is one with which most modern philosophers would agree.
Unfortunately, the books setting it forth are lost, and it is
difficult to reconstruct the doctrine from the hints that remain.

After Clitomachus, the Academy ceased to be skeptical, and from the
time of Antiochus (who died in 69 BC) its doctrines became, for
centuries, practically indistinguishable from those of the Stoics.

Skepticism, however, did not disappear. It was revived by the 
Cretan Aenesidemus, who came from Knossos, where, for aught 
we know, there may have been Skeptics two thousand years earlier, 
entertaining dissolute courtiers with doubts as to the divinity of 
the mistress of animals. The date of Aenesidemus is uncertain. 
He threw over the doctrines on probability advocated by Carneades, 
and reverted to the earliest forms of Skepticism. His influence was 
considerable; he was followed by the satirist Lucian in the second 
century AD, and also, slightly later, by Sextus Empiricus, the 
only Skeptic philosopher of antiquity whose works survive. There 
is, for example, a short treatise, "Arguments Against Belief in a 
God," translated by Edwyn Bevan in his Later Greek Religion, 
pp. 52--56, and said by him to be probably taken by Sextus 
Empiricus from Carneades, as reported by Clitomachus. 

This treatise begins by explaining that, in behavior, the Skeptics 
are orthodox: "We skeptics follow in practice the way of the world, 
but without holding any opinion about it. We speak of the Gods 
as existing and offer worship to the Gods and say that they exercise 
providence, but in saying this we express no belief, and avoid the 
rashness of the dogmatizers." 

He then argues that people differ as to the nature of God; for 
instance, some think Him corporeal, some incorporeal. Since we 
have no experience of Him, we cannot know His attributes. The 
existence of God is not self-evident, and therefore needs proof. 
There is a somewhat confused argument to show that no such 
proof is possible. He next takes up the problem of evil, and 
concludes with the words: 

> Those who affirm positively that God exists cannot avoid falling
> into an impiety. For if they say that God controls everything, they
> make Him the author of evil things; if, on the other hand, they say
> that He controls some things only, or that He controls nothing, they
> are compelled to make God either grudging or impotent, and to do
> that is quite obviously an impiety.

Skepticism, while it continued to appeal to some cultivated individuals until somewhere in the third century AD, was contrary 
to the temper of the age, which was turning more and more to 
dogmatic religion and doctrines of salvation. Skepticism had 
enough force to make educated men dissatisfied with the State 
religions, but it had nothing positive, even in the purely intellectual 
sphere, to offer in their place. From the Renaissance onwards, 
theological skepticism has been supplemented, in most of its 
advocates, by an enthusiastic belief in science, but in antiquity 
there was no such supplement to doubt. Without answering the 
arguments of the Skeptics, the ancient world turned aside from 
them. The Olympians being discredited, the way was left clear 
for an invasion of oriental religions, which competed for the 
favor of the superstitious until the triumph of Christianity. 

## Chapter XXVII THE EPICUREANS 

The two great new schools of the Hellenistic period, the 
Stoics and Epicureans, were contemporaneous in their 
foundation. Their founders, Zeno and Epicurus, were born 
at about the same time, and settled in Athens as heads of their 
respective sects within a few years of each other. It is therefore 
a matter of taste which to consider first. I shall begin with the 
Epicureans, because their doctrines were fixed once for all by 
their founder, whereas Stoicism had a long development, 
extending as far as the Emperor Marcus Aurelius, who died 
in AD 180. 

The main authority for the life of Epicurus is Diogenes Laertius, who
lived in the third century AD. There are, however, two difficulties:
first, Diogenes Laertius is himself ready to accept legends of little
or no historical value; second, part of his Life consists in reporting
the scandalous accusations brought against Epicurus by the Stoics, and
it is not always clear whether he is asserting something himself or
merely mentioning a libel. The scandals invented by the Stoics are
facts about them, to be remembered when their lofty morality is
praised; but they are not facts about Epicurus. For instance, there
was a legend that his mother was a quack priestess, as to which
Diogenes says:

> They (apparently the Stoics) say that he used to go round from house
> to house with his mother reading out the purification prayers, and
> assisted his father in elementary teaching for a miserable
> pittance.

On this Bailey comments:[^98] "If there is any truth in the story 
that he went about with his mother as an acolyte, reciting the 
formulae of her incantations, he may well have been inspired in 
quite early years with the hatred of superstition, which was afterwards so prominent a feature in his teaching." This theory is 
attractive, but, in view of the extreme unscrupulousness of later 
antiquity in inventing a scandal, I do not think it can be accepted 
as having any foundation.[^99] There is against it the fact that he 
had an unusually strong affection for his mother.[^100]

[^98]: _The Greek Atomists and Epicurus_, by Cyril Bailey, Oxford, 1928, p. 221. Mr. Bailey has made a specialty of Epicurus, and his book is invaluable to the student. 

[^99]: The Stoics were very unjust to Epicurus. Epictctus, for example, addressing him, says; "This is the life of which you pronounce yourself worthy: eating, drinking, copulation, evacuation and snoring." Book II, chap, xx, _Discourses of Epictetus_. 

[^100]: Gilbert Murray, Five Stages, p. 130 

The main facts of the life of Epicurus seem, however, fairly certain.
His father was a poor Athenian colonist in Samos; Epicurus was born in
342-1 BC, but whether in Samos or in Attica is not known. In any case,
his boyhood was passed in Samos. He states that he took to the study
of philosophy at the age of fourteen. At the age of eighteen, about
the time of Alexander's death, he went to Athens, apparently to
establish his citizenship, but while he was there the Athenian
colonists were turned out of Samos (322 BC). The family of Epicurus
became refugees in Asia Minor, where he rejoined them. At Taos, either
at this time, or perhaps earlier, he was taught philosophy by a
certain Nausiphanes, apparently a follower of Democritus. Although his
mature philosophy owes more to Democritus than to any other
philosopher, he never expressed anything but contempt for Nausiphanes,
whom he alluded to as "The Mollusc."

In the year 311 he founded his school, which was first in 
Mitylene, then in Lampsacus, and, from 307 onwards, in Athens, 
where he died in 270-1 BC. 

After the hard years of his youth, his life in Athens was placid, 
and was only troubled by his ill health. He had a house and a 
garden (apparently separate from the house), and it was in the 
garden that he taught. His three brothers, and some others, had 
been members of his school from the first, but in Athens his 
community was increased, not only by philosophic disciples, but 
by friends and their children, slaves and _hetaerae_. These last were 
made an occasion of scandal by his enemies, but apparently quite 
unjustly. He had a very exceptional capacity for purely human 
friendship, and wrote pleasant letters to the young children of 
members of the community. He did not practice that dignity and 
reserve in the expression of the emotions that was expected of 
ancient philosophers; his letters are amazingly natural and 
unaffected. 

The life of the community was very simple, partly on principle, 
and partly (no doubt) for lack of money. Their food and drink 
was mainly bread and water, which Epicurus found quite satisfying. "I am thrilled with pleasure in the body," he says, "when 
I live on bread and water, and I spit on luxurious pleasures, not 
for their own sake, but because of the inconveniences that follow 
them." The community depended financially, at least in part, 
on voluntary contributions. "Send me some preserved cheese," 
he writes, "that when I like, I may have a feast." To another 
friend: "Send us offerings for the sustenance of our holy body 
on behalf of yourself and your children." And again: "The only 
contribution I require is that which ordered the disciples to 
send me, even if they be among the Hyperboreans. I wish to 
receive from each of you two hundred and twenty drachmae[^101] a 
year and no more." 

[^101]: About five pounds. 

Epicurus suffered all his life from bad health, but learnt to endure
it with great fortitude. It was he, not a Stoic, who first maintained
that a man could be happy on the rack. Two letters written, one a few
days before his death, the other on the day of his death, show that he
had some right to this opinion. The first says: "Seven days before
writing this the stoppage became complete and I suffered pains such as
bring men to their last day. If anything happens to me, do you look
after the children of Metrodorus for four or five years, but do not
spend any more on them than you now spend on me." The second says: "On
this truly happy day of my life, as I am at the point of death, I
write this to you. The diseases in my bladder and stomach are pursuing
their course, lacking nothing of their usual severity: but against all
this is the joy in my heart at the recollection of my conversations
with you. Do you, as I might expect from your devotion from boyhood to
me and to philosophy, take good care of the children of Metrodorus."
Metrodorus, who had been one of his first disciples, was dead;
Epicurus provided for his children in his will.

Although Epicurus was gentle and kindly towards most people, 
a different side of his character appeared in his relations to philosophers, especially those to whom he might be considered indebted. "I suppose," he says, "that these grumblers will believe 
me to be a disciple of The Mollusc (Nausiphanes) and to have 
listened to his teaching in company with a few bibulous youths. 
For indeed the fellow was a bad man and his habits such as 
could never lead to wisdom."[^102] He never acknowledged the extent 
of his indebtedness to Democritus, and as for Leucippus, he 
asserted that there was no such philosopher meaning, no doubt, 
not that there was no such man, but that the man was not a 
philosopher. Diogenes Laertius gives a whole list of abusive 
epithets that he is supposed to have applied to the most eminent 
of his predecessors. With this lack of generosity towards other 
philosophers goes another grave fault, that of dictatorial dogmatism. His followers had to learn a kind of creed embodying 
his doctrines, which they were not allowed to question. To the 
end, none of them added or modified anything. When Lucretius, 
two hundred years later, turned the philosophy of Epicurus into 
poetry, he added, so far as can be judged, nothing theoretical to 
the master's teaching. Wherever comparison is possible, Lucretius 
is found to agree closely with the original, and it is generally 
held that, elsewhere, he may be used to fill in the gaps in our 
knowledge caused by the loss of all of Epicurus's three hundred 
books. Of his writings, nothing remains except a few letters, some 
fragments, and a statement of "Principal Doctrines." 

[^102]: _The Stoic and Epicurean Philosophers_, by W. J. Gates, p. 47. Where possible, I have availed myself of Mr. Gates's translations. 

The philosophy of Epicurus, like all those of his age (with the
partial exception of Skepticism), was primarily designed to secure
tranquillity. He considered pleasure to be the good, and adhered, with
remarkable consistency, to all the consequences of this view.
"Pleasure," he said, "is the beginning and end of the blessed life.
Diogenes Laertius quotes him as saying, in a book on _The End of
Life_, "I know not how I can conceive the good, if I withdraw the
pleasures of taste and withdraw the pleasures of love and those of
hearing and sight." Again: "The beginning and the root of all good is
the pleasure of the stomach; even wisdom and culture must be referred
to this." The pleasure of the mind, we are told, is the contemplation
of pleasures of the body. Its only advantage over bodily pleasures is
that we can learn to contemplate pleasure rather than pain, and thus
have more control over mental than over physical pleasures. "Virtue,"
unless it means "prudence in the pursuit of pleasure," is an empty
name. Justice, for example, consists in so acting as not to have
occasion to fear other men's resentment a view which leads to a
doctrine of the origin of society not unlike the theory of the Social
Contract.

Epicurus disagrees with some of his hedonist predecessors in
distinguishing between active and passive pleasures, or dynamic and
static pleasures. Dynamic pleasures consist in the attainment of a
desired end, the previous desire having been accompanied by pain.
Static pleasures consist in a state of equilibrium, which results from
the existence of the kind of state of affairs that would be desired if
it were absent. I think one may say that the satisfying of hunger,
while it is in progress, is a dynamic pleasure, but the state of
quiescence which supervenes when hunger is completely satisfied is a
static pleasure. Of these two kinds, Epicurus holds it more prudent to
pursue the second, since it is unalloyed, and does not depend upon the
existence of pain as a stimulus to desire. When the body is in a state
of equilibrium, there is no pain; we should, therefore, aim at
equilibrium and the quiet pleasures rather than at more violent joys.
Epicurus, it seems, would wish, if it were possible, to be always in
the state of having eaten moderately, never in that of voracious
desire to eat.

He is thus led, in practice, to regarding absence of pain, rather than
presence of pleasure, as the wise man's goal.[^103] The stomach may be
at the root of things, but the pains of stomach-ache outweigh the
pleasures of gluttony; accordingly Epicurus lived on bread, with a
little cheese on feast days. Such desires as those for wealth and
honor are futile, because they make a man restless when he might be
contented. "The greatest good of all is prudence: it is a more
precious thing even than philosophy." Philosophy, as he understood it,
was a practical system designed to secure a happy life; it required
only common sense, not logic or mathematics or any of the elaborate
training prescribed by Plato. He urges his young disciple and friend
Pythodes to "flee from every form of culture." It was a natural
consequence of his principles that he advised abstinence from public
life, for in proportion as a man achieves power he increases the
number of those who envy him and therefore wish to do him injury. Even
if he escapes outward misfortune, peace of mind is impossible in such
a situation. The wise man will try to live unnoticed, so as to have no
enemies.

[^103]: (For Epicurus) "Absence of pain is in itself pleasure, indeed in his ultimate analysis the truest pleasure." Bailey, _op. cit._, p. 249. 

Sexual love, as one of the most "dynamic: of pleasures, naturally 
comes under the ban. "Sexual intercourse," the philosopher 
declares, "has never done a man good and he is lucky if it has not 
harmed him." He was fond of children (other people's), but for 
the gratification of this taste he seems to have relied upon other 
people not to follow his advice. He seems, in fact, to have liked 
children against his better judgment; for he considered marriage 
and children a distraction from more serious pursuits. Lucretius, 
who follows him in denouncing love, sees no harm in sexual 
intercourse provided it is divorced from passion. 

The safest of social pleasures, in the opinion of Epicurus, is 
friendship. Epicurus, like Bentham, is a man who considers that 
all men, at all times, pursue only their own pleasure, sometimes 
wisely, sometimes unwisely; but, again like Bentham, he is constantly seduced by his own kindly and affectionate nature into 
admirable behavior from which, on his own theories, he ought 
to have refrained. He obviously liked his friends without regard 
to what he got out of them, but he persuaded himself that he was 
as selfish as his philosophy held all men to be. According to 
Cicero, he held that "friendship cannot be divorced from pleasure, 
and for that reason must be cultivated, because without it neither 
can we live in safety and without fear, nor even pleasantly." 
Occasionally, however, he forgets his theories more or less: "all 
friendship is desirable in itself," he says, adding "though it starts 
from the need of help."[^104] 

[^104]: On the subject of friendship and Epicurus's amiable inconsistency, see Bailey, _op. cit._, pp. 517-20. 

Epicurus, though his ethic seemed to others swinish and lacking 
in moral exaltation, was very much in earnest. As we have seen, 
he speaks of the community in the garden as "our holy body"; 
he wrote a book _On Holiness_; he had all the fervour of a religious 
reformer. He must have had a strong emotion of pity for the 
sufferings of mankind, and an unshakeable conviction that they 
would be greatly lessened if men would adopt his philosophy. It 
was a valetudinarian's philosophy, designed to suit a world in 
which adventurous happiness had become scarcely possible. Eat 
little, for fear of indigestion; drink little, for fear of next morning; 
eschew politics and love and all violently passionate activities; do 
not give hostages to fortune by marrying and having children; in 
your mental life, teach yourself to contemplate pleasures rather 
than pains. Physical pain is certainly a great evil, but if severe, 
it is brief, and if prolonged, it can be endured. by means of mental 
discipline and the habit of thinking of happy things in spite of it. 
Above all, live so as to avoid fear. 

It was through the problem of avoiding fear that Epicurus was 
led into theoretical philosophy. He held that two of the greatest 
sources of fear were religion and the dread of death, which were 
connected, since religion encouraged the view that the dead are 
unhappy. He therefore sought a metaphysic which would prove 
that the gods do not interfere in human affairs, and that the soul 
perishes with the body. Most modern people think of religion as 
a consolation, but to Epicurus it was the opposite. Supernatural 
interference with the course of nature seemed to him a source of 
terror, and immortality fatal to the hope of release from pain. 
Accordingly he constructed an elaborate doctrine designed to 
cure men of the beliefs that inspire fear. 

Epicurus was a materialist, but not a determinist. He followed 
Democritus in believing that the world consists of atoms and the 
void; but he did not believe, as Democritus did, that the atoms are 
at all times completely controlled by natural laws. The conception 
of necessity in Greece was, as we have seen, religious in origin, 
and perhaps he was right in considering that an attack on religion 
would be incomplete if it allowed necessity to survive. His atoms 
had weight, and were continually falling; not towards the center 
of the earth, but downwards in some absolute sense. Every now 
and then, however, an atom, actuated by something like free will, 
would swerve slightly from the direct downward path,[^105] and so 
would come into collision with some other atom. From this point 
onwards, the development of vortices, etc., proceeded in much the 
same way as in Democritus. The soul is material, and is composed 
of particles like those of breath and heat. (Epicurus thought 
breath and wind different in substance from air; they were not 
merely air in motion.) Soul-atoms are distributed throughout the 
body. Sensation is due to thin films thrown off by bodies and 
travelling on until they touch soul-atoms. These films may still 
exist when the bodies from which they originally proceeded have 
been dissolved; this accounts for dreams. At death, the soul is 
dispersed, and its atoms, which of course survive, are no longer 
capable of sensation, because they are no longer connected with 
the body. It follows, in the words of Epicurus, that "Death is 
nothing to us; for that which is dissolved, is without sensation, 
and that which lacks sensation is nothing to us." 

[^105]: An analogous view is urged in our day by Eddington, in his interpretation of the principle of indeterminacy. 

As for the gods, Epicurus firmly believes in their existence, since he
cannot otherwise account for the widespread existence of the idea of
gods. But he is persuaded that they do not trouble themselves with the
affairs of our human world. They are rational hedonists, who follow
his precepts, and abstain from public life; government would be an
unnecessary labour, to which, in their life of complete blessedness,
they feel no temptation. Of course, divination and augury and all such
practices are purely superstitious, and so is the belief in
Providence.

There is therefore no ground for the fear that we may incur the 
anger of the gods, or that we may suffer in Hades after death. 
Though subject to the powers of nature, which can be studied 
scientifically, we yet have free will, and are, within limits, the 
masters of our fate. We cannot escape death, but death, rightly 
understood, is no evil. If we live prudently, according to the 
maxims of Epicurus, we shall probably achieve a measure of 
freedom from pain. This is a moderate gospel, but to a man 
impressed with human misery it sufficed to inspire enthusiasm 

Epicurus has no interest in science on its own account; he values it
solely as providing naturalistic explanations of phenomena which
superstition attributes to the agency of the gods. When there are
several possible naturalistic explanations, he holds that there is no
point in trying to decide between them. The phases of the moon, for
example, have been explained in many different ways; any one of these,
so long as it does not bring in the gods, is as good as any other, and
it would be idle curiosity to attempt to determine which of them is
true. It is no wonder that the Epicureans contributed practically
nothing to natural knowledge. They served a useful purpose by their
protest against the increasing devotion of the later pagans to magic,
astrology, and divination; but they remained, like their founder,
dogmatic, limited, and without genuine interest in anything outside
individual happiness. They learnt by heart the creed of Epicurus, and
added nothing to it throughout the centuries during which the school
survived.

The only eminent disciple of Epicurus is the poet Lucretius 
(99-55 BC), who was a contemporary of Julius Caesar. In the 
last days of the Roman Republic, free thought was the fashion, 
and the doctrines of Epicurus were popular among educated 
people. The Emperor Augustus introduced an archaistic revival 
of ancient virtue and ancient religion, which caused the poem of 
Lucretius On the Nature of Things to become unpopular, and it 
remained so until the Renaissance. Only one manuscript of it 
survived die Middle Ages, and that narrowly escaped destruction 
by bigots. Hardly any great poet has had to wait so long for 
recognition, but in modern times his merits have been almost 
universally acknowledged. For example, he and Benjamin Franklin 
were Shelley's favorite authors. 

His poem sets forth in verse the philosophy of Epicurus. Although the
two men have the same doctrine, their temperaments are very different.
Lucretius was passionate, and much more in need of exhortations to
prudence than Epicurus was. He committed suicide, and appears to have
suffered from periodic insanity brought on, so some averred, by the
pains of love or the unintended effects of a love philtre. He feels
towards Epicurus as towards a saviour, and applies language of
religious intensity to the man whom he regards as the destroyer of
religion:[^106]

[^106]: I quote the translation of Mr. R. C. Trevelyan, Book 1, 60-79. 

> When prostrate upon earth lay human life  
> Visibly trampled down and foully crushed  
> Beneath Religion's cruelty, who meanwhile  
> Out of the regions of the heavens above  
> Showed forth her face, lowering on mortal men  
> With horrible aspect, first did a man of Greece  
> Dare to lift up his mortal eyes against her;  
> The first was he to stand up and defy her.  
> Him neither stories of the gods, nor lightnings,  
> Nor heaven with muttering menaces could quell,  
> But all the more did they arouse his soul's  
> Keen valour, till he longed to be the first  
> To break through the fast-bolted doors of Nature.  
> Therefore his fervent energy of mind  
> Prevailed, and he passed onward, voyaging far  
> Beyond the flaming ramparts of the world,  
> Ranging in mind and spirit far and wide  
> Throughout the unmeasured universe; and thence  
> A conqueror he returns to us, bringing back  
> Knowledge both of what can and what cannot  
> Rise into being, teaching us in fine 
> Upon what principle each thing has its powers  
> Limited, and its deep-set boundary stone.  
> Therefore now has Religion been cast down  
> Beneath men's feet, and trampled on in turn: 
> Ourselves heaven-high his victory exalts. 

The hatred of religion expressed by Epicurus and Lucretius is 
not altogether easy to understand, if one accepts the conventional 
accounts of the cheerfulness of Greek religion and ritual. Keats's 
_Ode on a Grecian Urn_, for instance, celebrates a religious ceremony, 
but not one which could fill men's minds with dark and gloomy 
terrors. I think popular beliefs were very largely not of this cheerful 
kind. The worship of the Olympians had less of superstitious 
cruelty than the other forms of Greek religion, but even the 
Olympian gods had demanded occasional human sacrifice until 
the seventh or sixth century BC, and this practice was recorded 
in myth and drama.[^107] Throughout the barbarian world, human 
sacrifice was still recognized in the time of Epicurus; until the 
Roman conquest, it was practiced in times of crisis, such as the 
Punic Wars, by even the most civilized of barbarian populations. 

[^107]: Lucretius instances the sacrifice of Iphigenia as an example of the harm wrought by religion. Book I, 85--100. 

As was shown most convincingly by Jane Harrison, the Greeks had, in
addition to the official cults of Zeus and his family, other more
primitive beliefs associated with more or less barbarous rites. These
were to some extent incorporated in Orphism, which became the
prevalent belief among men of religious temperament. It is sometimes
supposed that Hell was a Christian invention, but this is a mistake.
What Christianity did in this respect was only to systematize earlier
popular beliefs. From the beginning of Plato's Republic it is clear
that the fear of punishment after death was common in fifth-century
Athens, and it is not likely that it grew less in the interval between
Socrates and Epicurus. (I am thinking not of the educated minority,
but of the general population.) Certainly, also, it was common to
attribute plagues, earthquakes, defeats in war, and such calamities,
to divine displeasure or to failure to respect the omens. I think that
Greek literature and art are probably very misleading as regards
popular beliefs. What should we know of Methodism in the late
eighteenth century if no record of the period survived except its
aristocratic books and paintings? The influence of Methodism, like
that of religiosity in the Hellenistic age, rose from below; it was
already powerful in the time of Boswell and Sir Joshua Reynolds,
although from their allusions to it the strength of its influence is
not apparent. We must not, therefore, judge of popular religion in
Greece by the pictures on "Grecian Urns" or by the works of poets and
aristocratic philosophers. Epicurus was not aristocratic, either by
birth or through his associates; perhaps this explains his exceptional
hostility to religion.

It is through the poem of Lucretius that the philosophy of Epicurus has chiefly become known to readers since the Renaissance. 
What has most impressed them, when they were not professional 
philosophers, is the contrast with Christian belief in such matters 
as materialism, denial of Providence, and rejection of immortality. 
What is especially striking to a modern reader is to have these 
views which, nowadays, are generally regarded as gloomy and 
depressing presented as a gospel of liberation from the burden 
of fear. Lucretius is as firmly persuaded as any Christian of the 
importance of true belief in matters of religion. After describing 
how men seek escape from themselves when they are the victims 
of an inner conflict, and vainly seek relief in change of place, 
he says:[^108]

[^108]: Book III, 1068--76. I again quote Mr. R. C. Trevelyan's translation. 

> Each man flies from his own self;  
> Yet from that self in fact he has no power  
> To escape: he clings to it in his own despite,  
> And loathes it too, because, though he is sick,  
> He perceives not the cause of his disease.  
> Which if he could but comprehend aright,  
> Each would put all things else aside and first  
> Study to learn the nature of the world,  
> Since 'tis our state during eternal time,  
> Not for one hour merely, that is in doubt,  
> That state wherein mortals will have to pass  
> The whole time that awaits them after death.  

The age of Epicurus was a weary age, and extinction could 
appear as a welcome rest from travail of spirit. The last age of 
the Republic, on the contrary, was not, to most Romans, a time 
of disillusionment: men of titanic energy were creating out of 
chaos a new order, which the Macedonians had failed to do. But 
to the Roman aristocrat who stood aside from politics, and cared 
nothing for the scramble for power and plunder, the course of 
events must have been profoundly discouraging. When to this 
was added the affliction of recurrent insanity, it is not to be 
wondered at that Lucretius accepted the hope of non-existence 
as a deliverance. 

But the fear of death is so deeply rooted in instinct that the gospel
of Epicurus could not, at any time, make a wide popular appeal; it
remained always the creed of a cultivated minority. Even among
philosophers, after the time of Augustus, it was, as a rule, rejected
in favor of Stoicism. It survived, it is true, though with
diminishing vigor, for six hundred years after the death of Epicurus;
but as men became increasingly oppressed by the miseries of our
terrestrial existence, they demanded continually stronger medicine
from philosophy or religion. The philosophers took refuge, with few
exceptions, in Neoplatonism; the uneducated turned to various Eastern
superstitions, and then, in continually increasing numbers, to
Christianity, which, in its early form, placed all good in the life
beyond the grave, thus offering men a gospel which was the exact
opposite of that of Epicurus. Doctrines very similar to his, however,
were revived by the French _philosophes_ at the end of the eighteenth
century, and brought to England by Bentham and his followers; this was
done in conscious opposition to Christianity, which these men regarded
as hostilely as Epicurus regarded the religions of his day.

## Chapter XXVIII STOICISM 

STOICISM, while in origin contemporaneous with Epicureanism, had a
longer history and less constancy in doctrine. The teaching of its
founder Zeno, in the early part of the third century BC, was by no
means identical with that of Marcus Aurelius in the latter half of the
second century AD Zeno was a materialist, whose doctrines were, in the
main, a combination of Cynicism and Heraclitus; but gradually, through
an admixture of Platonism, the Stoics abandoned materialism, until, in
the end, little trace of it remained. Their ethical doctrine, it is
true, changed very little, and was what most of them regarded as of
the chief importance. liven in this respect, however, there is some
change of emphasis. As time goes on, continually less is said about
the other aspects of Stoicism, and continually more exclusive stress
is laid upon ethics and those parts of theology that are most relevant
to ethics. With regard to all the earlier Stoics, we are hampered by
the fact that their works survive only in a few fragments. Seneca,
Kpictetus, and Marcus Aurelius, who belong to the first and second
centuries AD, alone survive in complete books.

Stoicism is less Greek than any school of philosophy with which we
have been hitherto concerned. The early Stoics were mostly Syrian, the
later ones mostly Roman. Tarn (Hellenistic Civilization, p. 287)
suspects Chaldean influences in Stoicism. Uebenveg justly observes
that, in Hcllenizing the barbarian world, the Greeks dropped what only
suited themselves. Stoicism, unlike the earlier purely Greek
philosophies, is emotionally narrow, and in a certain sense fanatical;
but it also contains religious elements of which the world felt the
need, and which the Greeks seemed unable to supply. In particular, it
appealed to rulers: "nearly all the successors of Alexander we may say
all the principal kings in existence in the generations following Zeno
professed themselves Stoics," says Professor Gilbert Murray.

Zeno was a Phoenician, born at Citium, in Cyprus, at some time 
during the latter half of the fourth century BC It seems probable 
that his family were engaged in commerce, and that business 
interests were what first took him to Athens. When there, however, 
he became anxious to study philosophy. The views of the Cynics 
were more congenial to him than those of any other school, but 
he was something of an eclectic. The followers of Plato accused 
him of plagiarizing the Academy. Socrates was the chief saint of 
the Stoics throughout their history; his attitude at the time of 
his trial, his refusal to escape, his calmness in the face of death, 
and his contention that the perpetrator of injustice injures himself 
more than his victim, all fined in perfectly with Stoic teaching. 
So did his indifference to heat and cold, his plainness in matters 
of food and dress, and his complete independence of all bodily 
comforts. But the Stoics never took over Plato 1 * doctrine of ideas, 
and most of them rejected his arguments for immortality. Only 
the later Stoics followed him in regarding the soul as immaterial; 
the earlier Stoics agreed with Heraclitus in the view that the soul 
is composed of material fire. Verbally, this doctrine is also to be 
found in Epictetus and Marcus Aurelius, but it seems that in 
them the fire is not to be taken literally as one of the four elements 
of which physical things are composed. 

Zeno had no patience with metaphysical subtleties. Virtue was 
what he thought important, and he only valued physics and metaphysics in so far as they contributed to virtue. He attempted to 
combat the metaphysical tendencies of the age by means of 
common sense, which, in Greece, meant materialism. Doubts as 
to the trustworthiness of the senses annoyed him, and he pushed 
the opposite doctrine to extremes. 

"Zeno began by asserting the existence of the real world. 'What 
do you mean by real?' asked the Skeptic. 'I mean solid and material. 
I mean that this table is solid matter.' 'And God,' asked the 
Skeptic, 'and the Soul?' 'Perfectly solid,' said Zeno, 'more solid, 
if anything, than the table.' 'And virtue or justice or the Rule of 
Three; also solid matter?' 'Of course,' said Zeno, 'quite solid.'"[^109]

[^109]: Gilbert Murray, _The Stoic Philosophy_ (1915), p. 25.

It is evident that, at this point, Zeno, like many others, was 
hurried by anti-metaphysical zeal into a metaphysic of his own. 

The main doctrines to which the school remained constant throughout
are concerned with cosmic determinism and human freedom. Zeno believed
that there is no such thing as chance, and that the course of nature
is rigidly determined by natural laws. Originally there was only fire;
then the other elements---air, water, earth, in that order gradually
emerged. But sooner or later there will be a cosmic conflagration, and
all will again become fire. This, according to most Stoics, is not a
final consummation, like the end of the world in Christian doctrine,
but only the conclusion of a cycle; the whole process will be repeated
endlessly. Everything that happens has happened before, and will
happen again, not once, but countless times.

So far, the doctrine might seem cheerless, and in no respect more
comforting than ordinary materialism such as that of Democritus. But
this was only one aspect of it. The course of nature, in Stoicism as
in eighteenth-century theology, was ordained by a Lawgiver who was
also a beneficent Providence. Down to the smallest detail, the whole
was designed to secure certain ends by natural means. These ends,
except in so far as they concern gods and daemons, are to be found in
the life of man. Everything has a purpose connected with human beings.
Some animals are good to eat, some afford tests of courage; even bed
bugs are useful, since they help us to wake in the morning and not lie
in bed too long. The supreme Power is called sometimes God, sometimes
Zeus. Seneca distinguished this Zeus from the object of popular
belief, who was also real, but subordinate.

God is not separate from the world; He is the soul of the world, 
and each of us contains a part of the Divine Fire. All things are 
parts of one single system, which is called Nature; the individual 
life is good when it is in harmony with Nature. In one sense, every 
life is in harmony with Nature, since it is such as Nature's laws 
have caused it to be; but in another sense a human life is only in 
harmony with Nature when the individual will is directed to ends 
which are among those of Nature. Virtue consists in a will which 
is in agreement with Nature. The wicked, though perforce they 
obey God's law, do so involuntarily; in the simile of Cleanthes, 
they are like a dog tied to a cart, and compelled to go wherever 
it goes. 

In the life of an individual man, virtue is the sole good; such 
things as health, happiness, possessions, are of no account. Since 
virtue resides in the will, everything really good or bad in a man's 
life depends only upon himself. He may become poor, but what 
of it? He can still be virtuous. A tyrant may put him in prison, 
but he can still persevere in living in harmony with Nature. He 
may be sentenced to death, but he can die nobly, like Socrates. 
Other men have power only over externals; virtue, which alone 
is truly good, rests entirely with the individual. Therefore every 
man has perfect freedom, provided he emancipates himself from 
mundane desires. It is only through false judgments that such 
desires prevail; the sage whose judgments are true is master of 
his fate in all that he values, since no outside force can deprive 
him of virtue. 

There are obvious logical difficulties about this doctrine. If
virtue is really the sole good, a beneficent Providence must be 
solely concerned to cause virtue, yet the laws of Nature have 
produced abundance of sinners. If virtue is the sole good, there 
can be no reason against cruelty and injustice, since, as the Stoics 
are never tired of pointing out, cruelty and injustice afford the 
sufferer the best opportunities for the exercise of virtue. If the 
world is completely deterministic, natural laws will decide whether 
I shall be virtuous or not. If I am wicked, Nature compels me to 
be wicked, and the freedom which virtue is supposed to give is 
not possible for me. 

To a modern mind, it is difficult to feel enthusiastic about a
virtuous life if nothing is going to be achieved by it. We admire a
medical man who risks his life in an epidemic of plague, because we
think illness is an evil, and we hope to diminish its frequency. But
if illness is no evil, the medical man might as well stay comfortably
at home. To the Stoic, his virtue is an end it itself, not something
that does good. And when we take a longer view, what is the ultimate
outcome? A destruction of the present world by fire, and then a
repetition of the whole process. Could anything be more devastatingly
futile? There may be progress here and there, for a time, but in the
long run there is only recurrence. When we see something unbearably
painful, we hope that in time such things will cease to happen; but
the Stoic assures us that what is happening now will happen over and
over again. Providence, which sees the whole, must, one would think,
ultimately grow weary through despair.

There goes with this a certain coldness in the Stoic conception 
of virtue. Not only bad passions are condemned, but all passions. 
The sage does not feel sympathy; when his wife or his children 
die, he reflects that this event is no obstacle to his own virtue, 
and therefore he does not suffer deeply. Friendship, so highly 
prized by Epicurus, is all very well, but it must not be carried to 
the point where your friend's misfortunes can destroy your holy 
calm. As for public life, it may be your duty to engage in it, since 
it gives opportunities for justice, fortitude, and so on; but you 
must not be actuated by a desire to benefit mankind, since the 
benefits you can confer such as peace, or a more adequate supply 
of food are no true benefits, and, in any case, nothing matters 
to you except your own virtue. The Stoic is not virtuous in order 
to do good, but does good in order to be virtuous. It has not 
occurred to him to love his neighbor as himself; love, except in 
a superficial sense, is absent from his conception of virtue. 

When I say this, I am thinking of love as an emotion, not as a 
principle. As a principle, the Stoics preached universal love; this 
principle is found in Seneca and his successors, and probably was 
taken by them from earlier Stoics. The logic of the school led to 
doctrines which were softened by the humanity of its adherents, 
who were much better men than they would have been if they 
had been consistent. Kant who resembles them says that you 
must be kind to your brother, not because you are fond of him, 
but because the moral law enjoins kindness; I doubt, however, 
whether, in private life, he lived down to this precept. 

Leaving these generalities, let us come to the history of Stoicism. 

Of Zeno,[^110] only some fragments remain. From these it appears 
that he defined God as the fiery mind of the world, that he said 
God was a bodily substance, and that the whole universe formed 
the substance of God; Tertullian says that, according to Zeno, 
God runs through the material world as honey runs through the 
honeycomb. According to Diogenes Lacrtius, Zeno held that the 
General Law, which is Right Reason, pervading everything, is 
the same as Zeus, the Supreme Head of the government of the 
universe: God, Mind, Destiny, Zeus, are one thing. Destiny is a 
power which moves matter; "Providence" and "Nature" are 
other names for it. Zeno does not believe that there should be 
temples to the gods: "To build temples there will be no need: for 
a temple must not be held a thing of great worth or anything holy. 
Nothing can be of great worth or holy which is the work of 
builders and mechanics." He seems, like the later Stoics, to have 
believed in astrology and divination. Cicero says that he attributed 
a divine potency to the stars. Diogenes Laertius says: "All kinds 
of divination the Stoics leave valid. There must be divination, 
they say, if there is such a thing as Providence. They prove the 
reality of the art of divination by a number of cases in which 
predictions have come true, as Zeno asserts." Chrysippus is 
explicit on this subject. 

[^110]: For the sources of what follows, see Bevan, _Later Greek Religion_, p. 1ff. 

The Stoic doctrine as to virtue does not appear in the surviving 
fragments of Zeno, but seems to have been held by him. 

Cleanthes of Assos, the immediate successor of Zeno, is chiefly 
notable for two things. First: as we have already seen, he held 
that Aristarchus of Samos should be prosecuted for impiety 
because he made the sun, instead of the earth, the center of the 
universe. The second thing is his Hymn to Zeus, much of which 
might have been written by Pope, or any educated Christian in 
the century after Newton. Even more Christian is the short 
prayer of Cleanthes: 

> Lead me, O Zeus, and thou, O Destiny.  
> Lead thou me on.  
> To whatsoever task thou sendest me,  
> Lead thou me on.  
> I follow fearless, or, if in mistrust  
> I lag and will not, follow still I must.  

Chrysippus (280-207 BC) who succeeded Cleanthes, was a voluminous
author, and is said to have written seven hundred and five books. He
made Stoicism systematic and pedantic. He held that only Zeus, the
Supreme Fire, is immortal; the other gods, including the sun and moon,
are born and die. He is said to have considered that God has no share
in the causation of evil, but it is not clear how he reconciled this
with determinism. Elsewhere he deals with evil after the manner of
Hcraclitus, maintaining that opposites imply one another, and good
without evil is logically impossible: "There can be nothing more inept
than the people who suppose that good could have existed without the
existence of evil. Good and evil being antithetical, both must needs
subsist in opposition." In support of this doctrine he appeals to
Plato, not to Heraclitus.

Chrysippus maintained that the good man is always happy and the bad
man unhappy, and that the good man's happiness differs in no way from
God's. On the question whether the soul survives death, there were
conflicting opinions. Cleanthes maintained that all souls survive
until the next universal conflagration (when everything is absorbed
into God); but Chrysippus maintained that this is only true of the
souls of the wise. He was less exclusively ethical in his interests
than the later Stoics; in fact, he made logic fundamental. The
hypothetical and disjunctive syllogism, as well as the word
"disjunction," are due to the Stoics; so is the study of grammar and
the invention of "cases" in declension.[^111] Chrysippus, or other
Stoics inspired by his work, had an elaborate theory of knowledge, in
the main empirical and based on perception, though they allowed
certain ideas and principles, which were held to be established by
consensus gentium, the agreement of mankind. But Zeno, as well as the
Roman Stoics, regarded all theoretical studies as subordinate to
ethics: he says that philosophy is like an orchard, in which logic is
the walls, physics the trees, and ethics the fruit; or like an egg, in
which logic is the shell, physics the white, and ethics the
yolk.[^112] Chrysippus, it would seem, allowed more independent value
to theoretical studies. Perhaps his influence accounts for the fact
that among the Stoics there were many men who made advances in
mathematics and other sciences.

[^111]: See Barth, _Die Stoa_, 4th edition, Stuttgart, 1922. 
[^112]: _Ibid_. 

Stoicism, after Chrysippus, was considerably modified by two 
important men, Panaetius and Posidonius. Panaetius introduced 
a considerable element of Platonism, and abandoned materialism. 
He was a friend of the younger Scipio, and had an influence on 
Cicero, through whom, mainly, Stoicism became known to the 
Romans. Posidonius, under whom Cicero studied in Rhodes, 
influenced him even more. Posidonius was taught by Panaetius, 
who died about 110 BC. 

Posidonius (_ca._, 135--_ca.__ 51 BC) was a Syrian Greek, and was a
child when the Seleucid empire came to an end. Perhaps it was his
experience of anarchy in Syria that caused him to travel westward,
first to Athens, where he imbibed the Stoic philosophy, and then
further afield, to the western parts of the Roman Empire. 44 He saw
with his own eyes the sunset in the Atlantic beyond the verge of the
known world, and the African coast over against Spain, where the trees
were full of apes, and the villages of barbarous people inland from
Marseilles, where human heads hanging at the house-doors for trophies
were an every-day sight."[^113] He became a voluminous writer on
scientific subjects; indeed, one of the reasons for his travels was a
wish to study the tides, which could not be done in the Mediterranean.
He did excellent work in astronomy; as we saw in Chapter XXIV his
estimate of the distance of the sun was the best in antiquity.[^114]
He was also a historian of note---he continued Polybius. But it was
chiefly as an eclectic philosopher that he was known: he combined with
Stoicism much of Plato's teaching, which the Academy, in its skeptical
phase, appeared to have forgotten.

[^113]: Bevan, _Stoics and Skeptics_, p. 88. 
[^114]: He estimated that by sailing westward from Cadiz, India could be teached after 70,000 stades. "This remark was the ultimate foundation of Columbia's confidence." Tarn, _Hellenistic Civilization_, p. 249. 

This affinity to Plato is shown in his teaching about the soul 
and the life after death. Panaetius had said, as most Stoics did, 
that the soul perishes with the body. Posidonius, on the contrary, 
says that it continues to live in the air, where, in most cases, it 
remains unchanged until the next world-conflagration. There is 
no hell, but the wicked, after death, are not so fortunate as the 
good, for sin makes the vapours of the soul muddy, and prevents 
it from rising as far as the good soul rises. The very wicked stay 
near the earth and are reincarnated; the truly virtuous rise to the 
stellar sphere and spend their time watching the stars go round. 
They can help other souls; this explains (he thinks) the truth of 
astrology. Bevan suggests that, by this revival of Orphic notions 
and incorporation of Neo-Pythagorean beliefs, Posidonius may 
have paved the way for Gnosticism. He adds, very truly, that 
what was fatal to such philosophies as his was not Christianity 
but the Copernican theory.[^115] Cleanthes was right in regarding 
Aristarchus of Samos as a dangerous enemy. 

[^115]: The above account of Posidonius is mainly based on Chapter III of Edwyn Bevan's _Stoics and Skeptics_. 

Much more important historically (though not philosophically) 
than the earlier Stoics were the three who were connected with 
Rome: Seneca, Epictetus, and Marcus Aurelius---a minister, a 
slave, and an emperor, respectively. 

Seneca (_ca_. 3 BC to AD 65) was a Spaniard, whose father was 
a cultivated man living in Rome. Seneca adopted a political career, 
and was being moderately successful when he was banished to 
Corsica (AD 41) by the Emperor Claudius, because he had 
incurred the enmity of the Empress Messalina. Claudius's second 
wife Agrippina recalled Seneca from exile in AD 48, and appointed 
him tutor to her son, aged eleven. Seneca was less fortunate than 
Aristotle in his pupil, who was the Emperor Nero. Although, as a 
Stoic, Seneca officially despised riches, he amassed a huge fortune, 
amounting, it was said, to three hundred million sesterces (about 
three million pounds). Much of this he acquired by lending 
money in Britain; according to Dio, the excessive rates of interest 
that he exacted were among the causes of revolt in that country. 
The heroic Queen Boadicea, if this is true, was heading a rebellion 
against capitalism as represented by the philosophic apostle of 
austerity. 

Gradually, as Nero's excesses grew more unbridled, Seneca fell 
increasingly out of favor. At length he was accused, justly or 
unjustly, of complicity in a widespread conspiracy to murder 
Nero and place a new emperor some said, Seneca himself 
upon the throne. In view of his former services, he was graciously 
permitted to commit suicide (AD 65). 

His end was edifying. At first, on being informed of the Emperor's
decision, he set about making a will. When told that there was no time
allowed for such a lengthy business, he turned to his sorrowing family
and said: "Never mind, I leave you what is of far more value than
earthly riches, the example of a virtuous life" or words to that
effect. He then opened his veins, and summoned his secretaries to take
down his dying words; according to Tacitus, his eloquence continued to
flow during his last moments. His nephew Lucan, the poet, suffered a
similar death at the same time, and expired reciting his own verses.
Seneca was judged, in future ages, rather by his admirable precepts
than by his somewhat dubious practice. Several of the Fathers claimed
him as a Christian, and a supposed correspondence between him and
Saint Paul was accepted as genuine by such men as Saint Jerome.

Epictetus (born about AD 60, died about AD 100) is a very different
type of man, though closely akin as a philosopher. He was a Greek,
originally a slave of Epaphroditus, a freedman of Nero and then his
minister. He was lame as a result, it was said of a cruel punishment
in his days of slavery. He lived and taught at Rome until AD 90, when
the Emperor Domitian, who had no use for intellectuals, banished all
philosophers. Epictetus thereupon retired to Nicopolis in Epirus,
where, after some years spent in writing and teaching, he died.

Marcus Aurelius (AD 121-180) was at the other end of the social scale.
He was the adopted son of the good Emperor Antoninus Pius, who was his
uncle and his father-in-law, whom he succeeded in AD 161, and whose
memory he revered. As Emperor, he devoted himself to Stoic virtue. He
had much need of fortitude, for his reign was beset by calamities
earthquakes, pestilences, long and difficult wars, military
insurrections. His _Meditations_, which are addressed to himself, and
apparently not intended for publication, show that he felt his public
duties burdensome, and that he suffered from a great weariness. His
only son Commodus, who succeeded him, turned out to be one of the
worst of the many bad emperors, but successfully concealed his vicious
propensities so long as his father lived. The philosopher's wife
Faustina was accused, perhaps unjustly, of gross immorality, but he
never suspected her, and after her death took trouble about her
deification. He persecuted the Christians, because they rejected the
State religion, which he considered politically necessary. In all his
actions he was conscientious, but in most he was unsuccessful. He is a
pathetic figure: in a list of mundane desires to be resisted, the one
that he finds most seductive is the wish to retire to a quiet country
life. For this, the opportunity never came. Some of his _Meditations_
are dated from the camp, on distant campaigns, the hardships of which
eventually caused his death.

It is remarkable that Epictetus and Marcus Aurelius are completely at
one on all philosophical questions. This suggests that although social
circumstances affect the philosophy of an age, individual
circumstances have less influence than is sometimes thought upon the
philosophy of an individual. Philosophers are usually men with a
certain breadth of mind, who can largely discount the accidents of
their private lives; but even they cannot rise above the larger good
or evil of their time. In bad times they invent consolations; in good
times their interests are more purely intellectual.

Gibbon, whose detailed history begins with the vices of Commodus,
agrees with most eighteenth-century writers in regarding the period of
the Antonines as a golden age. "If a man were called upon," be says,
"to fix the period in the history of the world, during which the
condition of the human race was most happy and prosperous, he would,
without hesitation, name that which elapsed from the death of Domitian
to the accession of Commodus." It is impossible to agree altogether
with this judgment. The evil of slavery involved immense suffering,
and was sapping the vigor of the ancient world. There were
gladiatorial shows and fights with wild beasts, which were intolerably
cruel and must have debased the populations that enjoyed the
spectacle. Marcus Aurelius, it is true, decreed that gladiators should
fight with blunted swords; but this reform was short-lived, and he did
nothing about fights with wild beasts. The economic system was very
bad; Italy was going out of cultivation, and the population of Rome
depended upon the free distribution of grain from the provinces. All
initiative was concentrated in the Emperor and his ministers;
throughout the vast extent of the Empire, no one. except an occasional
rebellious general, could do anything but submit. Men looked to the
past for what was best; the future, they felt, would be at best a
weariness, and at worst a horror. When we compare the tone of Marcus
Aurelius with that of Bacon, or Locke, or Condorcet, we see the
difference between a tired and a hopeful age. In a hopeful age, great
present evils can be endured, because it is thought that they will
pass; but in a tired ape even real poods lose their savour. The Stoic
ethic suited the times of Epictetus and Marcus Aurelius, because its
gospel was one of endurance rather than hope.

Undoubtedly the age of the Antonines was much better than 
any later age until the Renaissance, from the point of view of the 
general happiness. But careful study shows that it was not so 
prosperous as its architectural remains would lead one to suppose. 
Graeco-Roman civilization had made very little impression on 
the agricultural regions; it was practically limited to the cities. 
Even in the cities, there was a proletariat which suffered very 
great poverty, and there was a large slave class. Rostovtseff sums 
up a discussion of social and economic conditions in the cities 
as follows:[^116]

[^116]: Rostovtseff, _The Social and Economic History qf the Roman Empire_, p. 179.

> foundations; that the large masses of the city population had either
> a very moderate income or lived in extreme poverty. In a word, we

> is misleading.

On earth, says Epictetus, we are prisoners, and in an earthly 
body. According to Marcus Aurelius, he used to say "Thou art 
a little soul bearing about a corpse." Zeus could not make the 
body free, but he gave us a portion of his divinity. God is the 
father of men, and we are all brothers. We should not say "I am 
an Athenian" or "I am a Roman," but "I am a citizen of the 
universe." If you were a kinsman of Caesar, you would feel safe; 
how much more should you feel safe in being a kinsman of God? 
If we understand that virtue is the only true good, we shall see 
that no real evil can befall us.

Epictctus is never weary of showing how we should deal with 
what are considered misfortunes, which he does often by means 
of homely dialogues. 

Like the Christians, he holds that we should love our enemies. 
In general, in common with other Stoics, he despises pleasure, 
but there is a kind of happiness that is noi to be despised. "Athens 
is beautiful. Yes, but happiness is far more beautiful freedom 
from passion and disturbance, the sense that your affairs depend 
on no one" (p. 428). Every man is an actor in a play, in which 
God has assigned the parts; it is our duty to perform our part 
worthily, whatever it may be. 

There is great sincerity and simplicity in the writings which record
the teaching of Epictetus. (They are written down from notes by his
pupil Arrian.) His morality is lofty and unworldly; in a situation in
which a man's main duty is to resist tyrannical power, it would be
difficult to find anything more helpful. In some respects, for
instance in recognizing the brotherhood of nian and in teaching the
equality of slaves, it is superior to anything to be found in Plato or
Aristotle or any philosopher whose thought is inspired by the City
State. The actual world, in the time of Epictctus, was very inferior
to the Athens of Pericles; but the evil in what existed liberated his
aspirations, and his ideal world is as superior to that of Plato as
his actual world is inferior to the Athens of the fifth century.

The _Meditations_ of Marcus Aurelius begin by acknowledging 
his indebtedness to his grandfather, father, adopted father, various 
teachers, and the gods. Some of the obligations he enumerates are 
curious. He learned (he says) from Diognetus not to listen to 
miracle-workers; from Rusticus, not to write poetry; from Sextus, 
to practice gravity without affectation; from Alexander the 
grammarian, not to correct bad grammar in others, but to use 
the right expression shortly afterwards; from Alexander the 
Platonist, not to excuse tardiness in answering a letter by the 
plea of press of business; from his adopted father, not to fall in 
love with boys. He owes it to the gods (he continues) that he was 
not brought up too long with his grandfather's concubine, and 
did not make proof of his virility too soon; that his children are 
neither stupid nor deformed in body; that his wife is obedient, 
affectionate, and simple; and that when he took to philosophy he 
did not waste time on history, syllogism, or astronomy. 

What is impersonal in the _Meditations_ agrees closely with 
Epictetus. Marcus Aurelius is doubtful about immortality, but 
says, as a Christian might: "Since it is possible that thou mayst 
depart from life this very moment, regulate every act and thought 
accordingly." Life in harmony with the universe is what is good; 
and harmony with the universe is the same thing as obedience 
to the will of God. 

> Everything harmonizes with me which is harmonious to thee, O
> Universe. Nothing for me is too early or too late, which is in due
> time for thee. Everything is fruit to me which thy seasons bring, O
> Nature: from thec are ail things, in thee are all things, to thee
> all things return. The poet says, Dear city of Cecrops; and wilt not
> thou say, Dear city of Zeus?"

One sees that Saint Augustine's City of God was in part taken 
over from the pagan Emperor. 

Marcus Aureiius is persuaded that God gives every man a special daemon
as his guide a belief which reappears in the Christian guardian angel.
He finds comfort in the thought of the universe as a closely-knit
whole; it is, he says, one living being, having one substance and one
soul. One of his maxims is: "Frequently consider the connection of all
things in the universe." "Whatever may happen to thee, it was prepared
for thee from all eternity; and the implication of causes was from
eternity spinning the thread of thy being." There goes with this, in
spite of his position in the Roman State, the Stoic belief in the
human race as one community: "My city and country, so far as I am
Antoninus, is Rome, but so far as I am a man, it is the world." There
is the difficulty that one finds in all Stoics, of reconciling
determinism with the freedom of the will. "Men exist for the sake of
one another," he says, when he is thinking of his duty as ruler. "The
wickedness of one man does no harm to another," he says on the same
page, when he is thinking of the doctrine that the virtuous will alone
is good. He never inferred that the goodness of one man does no good
to another, and that he would do no harm to anybody but himself if he
were as bad an Emperor as Nero; and yet this conclusion seems to
follow.

"It is peculiar to man," he says, "to love even those who do 
wrong. And this happens if, when they do wrong, it occurs to 
thee that they are kinsmen, and that they do wrong through 
ignorance and unintentionally, and that soon both of you will die; 
and above all, that the wrong-doer has done thee no harm, for 
he has not made thy ruling faculty worse than it was before." 

And again: "Love mankind, Follow God.... And it is 
enough to remember that Law rules all." 

These passages bring out very clearly the inherent contradictions 
in Stoic ethics and theology. On the one hand, the universe is a 
rigidly deterministic single whole, in which all that happens is 
the result of previous causes. On the other hand, the individual 
will is completely autonomous, and no man can be forced to sin 
by outside causes. This is one contradiction and there is a second 
closely connected with it. Since the will is autonomous, and the 
virtuous will alone is good, one man cannot do either good or 
harm to another; therefore benevolence is an illusion. Something 
must be said about each of these contradictions. 

The contradiction between free will and determinism is one of 
those that run through philosophy from early times to our own 
day, taking different forms at different times. At present it is the 
Stoic form that concerns us. 

I think that a Stoic, if we could make him submit to a Socratic 
interrogation, would defend his view more or less as follows: The 
universe is a single animate Being, having a soul which may also 
be called God or Reason. As a whole, this Being is free. God 
decided, from the first, that He would act according to fixed 
general laws, but He chose such laws as would have the best 
results. Sometimes, in particular cases, the results are not wholly 
desirable, but this inconvenience is worth enduring, as in human 
codes of law, for the sake of the advantage of legislative fixity. A 
human being is partly fire, partly of lower clay; in so far as he is 
fire (at any rate when it is of the best quality), he is part of God. 
When the divine part of a man exercises will virtuously, this will 
is part of God's, which is free; therefore in these circumstances 
the human will also is free. 

This is a good answer up to a point, but it breaks down when we
consider the causes of our volitions. We all know, as a matter of
empirical fact, that dyspepsia, for example, has a bad effect on a
man's virtue, and that, by suitable drugs forcibly administered,
will-power can be destroyed. Take Epictetus's favorite case, the man
unjustly imprisoned by a tyrant, of which there have been more
examples in recent years than at any other period in human history.
Some of these men have acted with Stoic heroism; some, rather
mysteriously, have not. It has become clear, not only that sufficient
torture will break down almost any man's fortitude, but also that
morphia or cocaine can reduce a man to docility. The will, in fact, is
only independent of the tyrant so long as the tyrant is unscientific.
This is an extreme example; but the same arguments that exist in
favor of determinism in the inanimate world exist also in the sphere
of human volitions in general. I do not say I do not think that these
arguments are conclusive; I say only that they are of equal strength
in both cases, and that there can be no good reason for accepting them
in one region and rejecting them in another. The Stoic, when he is
engaged in urging a tolerant attitude to sinners, will himself urge
that the sinful will is a result of previous causes; it is only the
virtuous will that seems to him free. This, however, is inconsistent.
Marcus Aurelius explains his own virtue as due to the good influence
of parents, grandparents, and teachers; the good will is just as much
a result of previous causes as the bad will. The Stoic may say truly
that his philosophy is a cause of virtue in those who adopt it, but it
seems that it will not have this desirable effect unless there is a
certain admixture of intellectual error. The realization that virtue
and sin alike are the inevitable result of previous causes (as the
Stoics should have held) is likely to have a somewhat paralyzing
effect on moral effort.

I come now to the second contradiction, that the Stoic, while he
preached benevolence, held, in theory, that no man can do either good
or harm to another, since the virtuous will alone is good, and the
virtuous will is independent of outside causes. This contradiction is
more patent than the other, and more peculiar to the Stoics (including
certain Christian moralists). The explanation of their not noticing it
is that, like many other people, they had two systems of ethics, a
superfine one for themselves, and an inferior one for "the lesser
breeds without the law." When the Stoic philosopher is thinking of
himself, he holds that happiness and all other worldly so-called goods
are worthless; he even says that to desire happiness is contrary to
nature, meaning that it involves lack of resignation to the will of
God. But as a practical man administering the Roman Empire, Marcus
Aurelius knows perfectly well that this son of thing won't do. It is
his duty to see that the grain-ships from Africa duly reach Rome, that
measures are taken to relieve the sufferings caused by pestilence, and
that barbarian enemies are not allowed to cross the frontier. That is
to say, in dealing with those of his subjects whom he does not regard
as Stoic philosophers, actual or potential, he accepts ordinary
mundane standards of what is good or bad. It is by applying these
standards that he arrives at his duty as an administrator. What is
odd is that this duty, itself, is in the higher sphere of what the
Stoic sage should do, although it is deduced from an ethic which the
Stoic sage regards as fundamentally mistaken.

The only reply that I can imagine to this difficulty is one which is
perhaps logically unassailable, but is not very plausible. It would, I
think, be given by Kant, whose ethical system is very similar to that
of the Stoics. True, he might say, there is nothing good but the good
will, but the will is good when it is directed to certain ends, that,
in themselves, are indifferent. It does not matter whether Mr. A is
happy or unhappy, but I, if I am virtuous, shall act in a way which I
believe will make him happy, because that is what the moral law
enjoins. I cannot make Mr. A virtuous, because his virtue depends only
upon himself; but I can do something towards making him happy, or
rich, or learned, or healthy. The Stoic ethic may therefore be stated
as follows: Certain things are vulgarly considered goods, but this is
a mistake; what is good is a will directed towards securing these
false goods for other people. This doctrine involves no logical
contradiction, but it loses all plausibility if we genuinely believe
that what are commonly considered goods are worthless, for in that
case the virtuous will might just as well be directed to quite other
ends.

There is, in fact, an element of sour grapes in Stoicism. We 
can't be happy, but we can be good; let us therefore pretend that, 
so long as we are good, it doesn't matter being unhappy. This 
doctrine is heroic, and, in a bad world, useful; but it is neither 
quite true nor, in a fundamental sense, quite sincere. 

Although the main importance of the Stoics was ethical, there 
were two respects in which their teaching bore fruit in other fields. 
One of these is theory of knowledge; the other is the doctrine of 
natural law and natural rights. 

In theory of knowledge, in spite of Plato, they accepted perception;
the deceptiveness of the senses, they held, was really false judgment,
and could be avoided by a little care. A Stoic philosopher, Sphaerus,
an immediate disciple of Zeno, was once invited to dinner by King
Ptolemy, who, having heard of this doctrine, offered him a pomegranate
made of wax. The philosopher proceeded to try to eat it, whereupon the
king laughed at him. He replied that he had felt no certainty of its
being a real pomegranate, but had thought it unlikely that anything
inedible would be supplied at the royal table.[^120] In this answer he
appealed to a Stoic distinction, between those things which can be
known with certainty on the basis of perception, and those which, on
this basis, are only probable. On the whole, this doctrine was sane
and scientific.

[^120]: _Diogenes Laertius_, Vol. VII, 177. 

Another doctrine of theirs in theory of knowledge was more 
influential, though more questionable. This was their belief in 
innate ideas and principles. Greek logic was wholly deductive, 
and this raised the question of first premisses. First premises had 
to be, at least in part, general, and no method existed of proving 
them. The Stoics held that there are certain principles which are 
luminously obvious, and are admitted by all men; these could be 
made, as in Euclid's _Elements_, the basis of deduction. Innate ideas, 
similarly, could be used as the starting-point of definitions. This 
point of view was accepted throughout the Middle Ages, and 
even by Descartes. 

The doctrine of natural right, as it appears in the sixteenth,
seventeenth, and eighteenth centuries, is a revival of a Stoic
doctrine, though with important modifications. It was the Stoics who
distinguished jus naturale from jut gentium. Natural law was derived
from first principles of the kind held to underlie all general
knowledge. By nature, the Stoics held, all human beings are equal.
Marcus Aurelius, in his Meditations, favors "a polity in which there
is the same law for all, a polity administered with regard to equal
rights and equal freedom of speech, and a kingly government which
respects most of all the freedom of the governed." This was an ideal
which could not be consistently realized in the Roman Empire, but it
influenced legislation, particularly in improving the status of women
and slaves. Christianity took over this part of Stoic teaching along
with much of the rest. And when at last, in the seventeenth century,
the opportunity came to combat despotism effectually, the Stoic
doctrines of natural law and natural equality, in their Christian
dress, acquired a practical force which, in antiquity, not even an
emperor could to them.

## Chapter XXIX THE ROMAN EMPIRE IN RELATION TO CULTURE 

The Roman Empire affected the history of culture in various 
more or less separate ways. 

First: there is the direct effect of Rome on Hellenistic 
thought. This is not very important or profound. 

Second: the effect of Greece and the East on the western half 
of the empire. This was profound and lasting, since it included 
the Christian religion. 

Third: the importance of the long Roman peace in diffusing 
culture and in accustoming men to the idea of a single civilization 
associated with a single government. 

Fourth: the transmission of Hellenistic civilization to the 
Mohammedans, and thence ultimately to western Europe. 

Before considering these influences of Rome, a very brief 
synopsis of the political history will be useful. 

Alexander's conquests had left the western Mediterranean untouched; it
was dominated, at the beginning of the third century BC, by two
powerful City States, Carthage and Syracuse. In the first and second
Punic Wars (264-241 and 218-201), Rome conquered Syracuse and reduced
Carthage to insignificance. During the second century, Rome conquered
the Macedonian monarchies Egypt, it is true, lingered on as a vassal
state until the death of Cleopatra (30 BC). Spain was conquered as an
incident in the war with Hannibal; France was conquered by Caesar in
the middle of the first century BC, and England was conquered about a
hundred years later. The frontiers of the Empire, in its great days,
were the Rhine and Danube in Europe, the Euphrates in Asia, and the
desert in North Africa.

Roman imperialism was, perhaps, at its best in North Africa 
(important in Christian history as the home of Saint Cyprian and 
Saint Augustine), where large areas, uncultivated before and after 
Roman times, were rendered fertile and supported populous cities. 
The Roman Empire was on the whole stable and peaceful for 
over two hundred years, from the accession of Augustus (30 BC) 
until the disasters of the third century. 

Meanwhile the constitution of the Roman State had undergone important
developments. Originally, Rome was a small City State, not very unlike
those of Greece, especially such as, like Sparta, did not depend upon
foreign commerce. Kings, like those of Homeric Greece, had been
succeeded by an aristocratic republic. Gradually, while the
aristocratic element, embodied in the Senate, remained powerful,
democratic elements were added; the resulting compromise was regarded
by Panaetius the Stoic (whose views are reproduced by Polybius and
Cicero) as an ideal combination of monarchical, aristocratic, and
democratic elements. But conquest upset the precarious balance; it
brought immense new wealth to the senatorial class, and, in a slightly
lesser degree, to the "knights," as the upper middle class were
called. Italian agriculture, which had been in the hands of small
farmers growing grain by their own labour and that of their families,
came to be a matter of huge estates belonging to the Roman
aristocracy, where vines and olives were cultivated by slave labour.
The result was the virtual omnipotence of the Senate, which was used
shamelessly for the enrichment of individuals, without regard for the
interests of the State or the welfare of its subjects.

A democratic movement, inaugurated by the Gracchi in the 
latter half of the second century BC, led to a series of civil wars, 
and finally as so often in Greece to the establishment of a 
"tyranny." It is curious to see the repetition, on such a vast scale, 
of developments which, in Greece, had been confined to minute 
areas. Augustus, the heir and adopted son of Julius Caesar, who 
reigned from 30 BC to AD 14, put an end to civil strife, and (with 
few exceptions) to external wars of conquest. For the first time 
since the beginnings of Greek civilization, the ancient world 
enjoyed peace and security. 

Two things had ruined the Greek political system: first, the 
claim of each city to absolute sovereignty; second, the bitter and 
bloody strife between rich and poor within most cities. After the 
conquest of Carthage and the Hellenistic kingdoms, the first of 
these causes no longer afflicted the world, since no effective 
resistance to Rome was possible. But the second cause remained. 
In the civil wars, one general would proclaim himself the champion 
of the Senate, the other of the people. Victory went to the one 
who offered the highest rewards to the soldiers. The soldiers 
wanted not only pay and plunder, but grants of land; therefore 
each civil war ended in the formally legal expulsion of many 
existing landholders, who were nominally tenants of the State, to 
make room for the legionaries of the victor. The expenses of the 
war, while in progress, were defrayed by executing rich men and 
confiscating their property. This system, disastrous as it was, 
could not easily be ended; at last, to every one's surprise, Augustus 
was so completely victorious that no competitor remained to 
challenge his claim to power. 

To the Roman world, the discovery that the period of civil war was
ended came as a surprise, which was a cause of rejoicing to all except
a small senatorial party. To every one else, it was a profound relief
when Rome, under Augustus, at last achieved the stability and order
which Greeks and Macedonians had sought in vain, and which Rome,
before Augustus, had also failed to produce. In Greece, according to
Rostovtseff, republican Rome had "introduced nothing new, except
pauperization, bankruptcy, and a stoppage of all independent political
activity."[^121]

[^121]: _History of the Ancient World_, Vol. II, p. 255. 

The reign of Augustus was a period of happiness for the Roman Empire.
The administration of the provinces was at last organized with some
regard to the welfare of the population, and not on a purely predatory
system. Augustus was not only officially deified after his death, but
was spontaneously regarded as a god in various provincial cities.
Poets praised him, the commercial classes found the universal peace
convenient, and even the Senate, which he treated with all the outward
forms of respect, lost no opportunity of heaping honors and offices on
his head.

But although the world was happy, some savour had gone out of life,
since safety had been preferred to adventure. In early times, every
free Greek had had the opportunity of adventure; Philip and Alexander
put an end to this state of affairs, and in the Hellenistic world only
Macedonian dynasts enjoyed anarchic freedom. The Greek world lost its
youth, and became either cynical or religious. The hope of embodying
ideals in earthly institutions faded, and with it the best men lost
their zest. Heaven, for Socrates, was a place where he could go on
arguing; for philosophers after Alexander, it was something more
different from their existence here below.

In Rome, a similar development came later, and in a less painful form.
Rome was not conquered, as Greece was, but had, on the contrary, the
stimulus of successful imperialism. Throughout the period of the civil
wars, it was Romans who were responsible for the disorders. The Greeks
had not secured peace and order by submitting to the Macedonians,
whereas both Greeks and Romans secured both by submitting to Augustus.
Augustus was a Roman, to whom most Romans submitted willingly, not
only on account of his superior power; moreover he took pains to
disguise the military origin of his government, and to base it upon
decrees of the Senate. The adulation expressed by the Senate was, no
doubt, largely insincere, but outside the senatorial class no one felt
humiliated.

The mood of the Romans was like that of _jeune homme range_ in
nineteenth-century France, who, after a life of amatory adventure,
settles down to a marriage of reason. This mood, though contented, is
not creative. The great poets of the Augustan age had been formed in
more troubled times; Horace fled at Philippi, and both he and Virgil
lost their farms in confiscations for the benefit of victorious
soldiers. Augustus, for the sake of stability, set to work, somewhat
insincerely, to restore ancient piety, and was therefore necessarily
rather hostile to free inquiry. The Roman world began to become
stereotyped, and the process continued under later emperors.

The immediate successors of Augustus indulged in appalling 
cruelties towards Senators and towards possible competitors for 
the purple. To some extent, the misgovernment of this period 
extended to the provinces; but in the main the administrative 
machine created by Augustus continued to function fairly well. 

A better period began with the accession of Trajan in A.D, 98, and
continued until the death of Marcus Aurelius in AD 180. During this
time, the government of the Empire was as good as any despotic
government can be. The third century, on the contrary, was one of
appalling disaster. The army realized its power, made and unmade
emperors in return for cash and the promise of a life without warfare,
and ceased, in consequence, to be an effective fighting force. The
barbarians, from north and east, invaded and plundered Roman
territory. The army, preoccupied with private gain and civil discord,
was incompetent in defense. The whole fiscal system broke down, since
there was an immense diminution of resources and, at the same time, a
vast increase of expenditure in unsuccessful war and in bribery of the
army. Pestilence, in addition to war, greatly diminished the
population. It seemed as if the Empire was about to fall.

This result was averted by two energetic men, Diocletian (AD 
286-305) and Constantine, whose undisputed reign lasted from 
AD 312 to 337. By them the Empire was divided into an eastern 
and western half, corresponding, approximately, to the division 
between the Greek and Latin languages. By Constantine the 
capital of the eastern half was established at Byzantium, to which 
he gave the new name of Constantinople. Diocletian curbed the 
army, for a while, by altering its character; from his time onwards, 
the most effective fighting forces were composed of barbarians, 
chiefly German, to whom all the highest commands were open. 
This was obviously a dangerous expedient, and early in the fifth 
century it bore its natural fruit. The barbarians decided that it 
was more profitable to fight for themselves than for a Roman 
master. Nevertheless it served its purpose for over a century. 
Diocletian's administrative reforms were equally successful for a 
time, and equally disastrous in the long run. The Roman system 
was to allow local self-government to the towns, and to leave 
their officials to collect the taxes, of which only the total amount 
due from any one town was fixed by the centra) authorities. 
This system had worked well enough in prosperous times, but 
now, in the exhausted state of the empire, the revenue demanded 
was more than could be borne without excessive hardship. The 
municipal authorities were personally responsible for the taxes, 
and fled to escape payment. Diocletian compelled well-to-do 
citizens to accept municipal office, and made flight illegal. From 
similar motives he turned the rural population into serfs, tied to 
the soil and forbidden to migrate. This system was kept on by 
later emperors. 

Constantine's most important innovation was the adoption of
Christianity as the State religion, apparently because a large
proportion of the soldiers were Christian.[^122] The result of this
was that when, during the fifth century, the Germans destroyed the
Western Empire, its prestige caused them to adopt the Christian
religion, thereby preserving for western Europe so much of ancient
civilization as had been absorbed by the Church.

[^122]: See Rottovtseff, _History of the Ancient World_, Vol. II, p. 332. 

The development of the territory assigned to the eastern half of the
Empire was different. The Eastern Empire, though continually
diminishing in extent (except for the transient conquests of Justinian
in the sixth century), survived until 1453, when Constantinople was
conquered by the Turks. But most of what had been Roman provinces in
the east, including also Africa and Spain in the west, became
Mohammedan. The Arabs, unlike the Germans, rejected the religion, but
adopted the civilization, of those whom they had conquered. The
Eastern Empire was Greek, not Latin, in its civilization; accordingly,
from the seventh to the eleventh centuries, it was it and the Arabs
who preserved Greek literature and whatever survived of Greek, as
opposed to Latin, civilization. From the eleventh century onward, at
first through Moorish influences, the west gradually recovered what it
had lost of the Grecian heritage.

I come now to the four ways in which the Roman Empire 
affected the history of culture. 

I. _The direct effect of Rome on Greek thought_. This begins in 
the second century BC, with two men, the historian Polybius, 
and the Stoic philosopher Panaetius. The natural attitude of the 
Greek to the Roman was one of contempt mingled with fear; 
the Greek felt himself more civilized, but politically less powerful. 
If the Romans were more successful in politics, that only showed 
that politics is an ignoble pursuit. The average Greek of the 
second century BC was pleasureloving, quick-witted, clever in 
business, and unscrupulous in all things. There were, however, 
still men of philosophic capacity. Some of these notably the 
skeptics, such as Carneades had allowed cleverness to destroy 
seriousness. Some, like the Epicureans and a section of the Stoics, 
had withdrawn wholly into a quiet private life. But a few, with more 
insight than had been shown by Aristotle in relation to Alexander, 
realized that the greatness of Rome was due to certain merits 
which were lacking among the Greeks. 

The historian Polybius, born in Arcadia about 200 BC, was sent to Rome
as a prisoner, and there had the good fortune to become the friend of
the younger Scipio, whom he accompanied on many of his campaigns. It
was uncommon for a Greek to know Latin, though most educated Romans
knew Greek; the circumstances of Polybius, however, led him to a
thorough familiarity with Latin. He wrote, for the benefit of the
Greeks, the history of the later Punic Wars, which enabled Rome to
conquer the world. His admiration of the Roman constitution was
becoming out of date while he wrote, but until his time it had
compared very favorably, in stability and efficiency, with the
continually changing constitutions of most Greek cities. The Romans
naturally read his history with pleasure; whether the Greeks did so is
more doubtful.

Panaetius the Stoic has been already considered in the preceding 
chapter. He was a friend of Polybius, and, like him, a protege of 
the younger Scipio. While Scipio lived, he was frequently in 
Rome, but after Scipio's death in 129 BC he stayed in Athens 
as head of the Stoic school. Rome still had, what Greece had lost, 
the hopefulness connected with the opportunity for political 
activity. Accordingly the doctrines of Panaetius were more 
political, and less akin to those of the Cynics, than were those of 
earlier Stoics. Probably the admiration of Plato felt by cultivated 
Romans influenced him in abandoning the dogmatic narrowness 
of his Stoic predecessors. In the broader form given to it by him 
and by his successor Posidonius, Stoicism strongly appealed to 
the more serious among the Romans. 

At a later date, Epictetus, though a Greek, lived most of his life 
in Rome. Rome supplied him with most of his illustrations; he is 
always exhorting the wise man not to tremble in the presence of 
the Emperor. We know the influence of Epictetus on Marcus 
Aurelius, but his influence on the Greeks is hard to trace. 

Plutarch (ca. AD 46--120), in his _Lives of the Noble Grecians and 
Romans_, traced a parallelism between the most eminent men of 
the two countries. He spent a considerable time in Rome, and was 
honored by the Emperors Hadrian and Trajan. In addition to 
his Lives, he wrote numerous works on philosophy, religion, 
natural history, and morals. His _Lives_ are obviously concerned 
to reconcile Greece and Rome in men's thoughts. 

On the whole, apart from such exceptional men, Rome acted as a blight
on the Greek-speaking part of the Empire. Thought and art alike
declined. Until the end of the second century AD, life, for the
well-to-do, was pleasant and easy-going; there was no incentive to
strenuousness, and little opportunity for great achievement. The
recognized schools of philosophy the Academy, the Peripatetics, the
Epicureans, and the Stoics continued to exist until they were closed
by Justinian. None of these, however, showed any vitality throughout
the time after Marcus Aurelius, except the Neoplatonists in the third
century AD, whom we shall consider in the next chapter; and these men
were hardly at all influenced by Rome. The Latin and Greek halves of
the Empire became more and more divergent; the knowledge of Greek
became rare in the west, and after Constantine Latin, in the east,
survived only in law and in the army.

II. _The influence of Greece and the East on Rome_. There are here 
two very different things to consider: first, the influence of Hellenic 
art and literature and philosophy on the most cultivated Romans; 
second, the spread of non-Hellenic religions and superstitions 
throughout the Western world. 

(1) When the Romans first came in contact with Greeks, they became
aware of themselves as comparatively barbarous and urcouth. The Greeks
were immeasurably their superiors in many ways: in manufacture and in
the technique of agriculture; in the kinds of knowledge that are
necessary for a good official; in conversation and the art of enjoying
life; in art and literature and philosophy. The only tilings in which
the Romans were superior were military tactics and social cohesion.
The relation of the Romans to the Creeks was something like that of
the Prussians to the French in 1814 and 1815; but this latter was
temporary, whereas the other lasted a long time. After the Punic Wars,
young Romans conceived an admiration for the Greeks. They learnt the
Greek language, they copied Greek architecture, they employed Greek
sculptors. The Roman gods were identified with the gods of Greece. The
Trojan origin of the Romans was invented to make a connection with the
Homeric myths. Latin poets adopted Greek meters, Latin philosophers
took over Greek theories. To the end, Rome was culturally parasitic on
Greece. The Romans invented no art forms, constructed no original
system of philosophy, and made no scientific discoveries. They made
good roads, systematic legal codes, and efficient armies; for the rest
they looked to Greece.

The Hellenizing of Rome brought with it a certain softening of
manners, abhorrent to the elder Cato. Until the Punic Wars, the Romans
had been a bucolic people, with the virtues and vices ot farmers:
austere, industrious, brutal, obstinate, and stupid. Their family life
had been stable and solidly built on the _patria potestas_; women and
young people were completely subordinated. All this changed with the
influx of sudden wealth. The small farms disappeared, and were
gradually replaced by huge estates on which slave labour was employed
to carry out new scientific kinds of agriculture. A great class of
traders grew up, and a large number of men enriched by plunder, like
the nabobs in eighteenth-century England. Women, who had been virtuous
slaves, became free and dissolute; divorce became common; the rich
ceased to have children. The Greeks, who had gone through a similar
development centuries ago, encouraged, by their example, what
historians call the decay of morals. Even in the most dissolute times
of the Empire, the average Roman still thought of Rome as the upholder
of a purer ethical standard against the decadent corruption of Greece.

The cultural influence ot Greece on the Western Kmpire diminished
rapidly from the third century AD onwards, chiefly because culture in
general decayed. For this there were many causes, but one in
particular must be mentioned. In the last times of the Western Empire,
the government was more undisguisedly a military tyranny than it had
been, and the army usually selected a successful general as emperor;
but the army, even in its highest ranks, was no longer composed of
cultivated Romans, but of semi-barbarians from the frontier. These
rough soldiers had no use for culture, and regarded the civilized
citizens solely as sources of revenue. Private persons were too
impoverished to support much in the way of education, and the State
considered education unnecessary. Consequently, in the West, only a
few men of exceptional learning continued to read Greek.

(2) Non-Hellenic religion and superstition, on the contrary, 
acquired, as time went on, a firmer and firmer hold on the West. 
We have already seen how Alexander's conquests introduced the 
Greek world to the beliefs of Babylonians, Persians, and Egyptians. 
Similarly the Roman conquests made the Western world familiar 
with these doctrines, and also with those of Jews and Christians. 
I shall consider what concerns the Jews anJ Christians at a later 
stage; for the present, I shall confine myself as far as possible to 
pagan superstitions.[^123]

[^123]: See Cumont, _Oriental Religions in Roman Paganism_. 


In Rome every sect and every prophet was represented, and 
sometimes won favor in the highest government circles. Lucian, 
who stood for sane skepticism in spite of the credulity of his age. 
tells an amusing story, generally accepted as broadly true, about 
a prophet and miracle-worker called Alexander the Paphlagonian. 
This man healed the sick and foretold the future, with excursions 
into blackmail. His fame reached the ears of Marcus Aurelius, 
then fighting the Marcomanni on the Danube. The Emperor 
consulted him as to how to win the war, and was told that if he 
threw two lions into the Danube a great victory would result. He 
followed the advice of the seer, but it was the Marcomanni who 
won the great victor)'. In spite of this mishap, Alexander's fame 
continued to grow. A prominent Roman of consular rank, Rutilianus, after consulting him on many points, at last sought his 
advice as to the choice of a wife. Alexander, like Endymion, had 
enjoyed the favors of the moon, and by her had a daughter, 
whom the oracle recommended to Rutilianus. "Rutilianus, who 
was at the time sixty years old, at once complied with the divine 
injunction, and celebrated his marriage by sacrificing whole 
hecatombs to his celestial mother-in-law."[^124]

[^124]: Benn, _The Greek Philosophers_, Vol. II, p. 226. 

More important than the career of Alexander the Paphlagonian was the
reign of the Krnperor Klagabalus or Heliogabalus (AD 218--22), who
was, until his elevation by the choice of the army, a Syrian priest of
the sun. In his slow progress from Syria to Rome, he was preceded by
his portrait, sent as a present to the Senate. "He was drawn in his
sacerdotal robes of silk and gold, after the loose flowing fashion of
the Medes and Phoenicians; his head was covered with a lofty tiara,
his numerous collars and bracelets were adorned with gems of
inestimable value. His eyebrows were tinged with black, and his cheeks
painted with an artificial red and white. The grave senators confessed
with a sigh, that, after having long experienced the stern tyranny of
their own countrymen, Rome was at length humbled beneath the
effeminate luxury of Oriental despotism."[^125] Supported by a large
section in the army, he proceeded, with fanatical zeal, to introduce
in Rome the religious practices of the East; his name was that of the
sun-god worshipped at Emesa, where he had been chief priest. His
mother, or grandmother, who was the real ruler, perceived that he had
Kone too far, and deposed him in favor of her nephew Alexander
(222--35), whoe Oriental proclivities were more moderate. The mixture
of creeds that wa$ possible in his day was illustrated in his private
chapel, in which he placed the statues of Abraham Orpheus, Apollonius
of Tyana, and Christ.

[^125]: Gibbon, chap. vi. 

The religion of Mithras, which was of Persian origin, was a close
competitor of Christianity, especially during the latter half of the
third century AD The emperors, who were making desperate attempts to
control the army, felt that religion might give a much needed
stability; but it would have to be one of the new religions, since it
was these that the soldiers favored. The cult was introduced at Rome,
and had much to commend it to the military mind. Mithras was a
sun-god, but not so effeminate as his Syrian colleague; he was a god
concerned with war, the great war between good and evil which had been
part of the Persian creed since Zoroaster. Rostovtseff[^126]
reproduces a bas-relief representing his worship, which was found in a
subterranean sanctuary at Heddernheim in Germany, and shows that his
disciples must have been numerous among the soldiers, not only in the
East, but in the West also.

[^126]: _History of the Ancient World_, Vol. II, p. 343. 

Constantine's adoption of Christianity was politically successful,
whereas earlier attempts to introduce a new religion failed; but the
earlier attempts were, from a governmental point of view, very similar
to his. All alike derived their possibility of success from the
misfortunes and weariness of the Roman world. The traditional
religions of Greece and Rome were suited to men interested in the
terrestrial world, and hopeful of happiness on earth. Asia, with a
longer experience of despair, had evolved more successful antidotes in
the form of other-worldly hopes; of all these, Christianity was the
most effective in bringing consolation. But Christianity, by the time
it became the State religion, had absorbed much from Greece, and
transmitted this, along with the Judaic element, to succeeding ages in
the West.

III. _The unification of government and culture_. We owe it first to
Alexander and then to Rome that the achievements of the great age of
Greece were not lost to the world, like those of the Minoan age. In
the fifth century BC, a Jenghiz Khan, if one had happened to arise,
could have wiped out all that was important in the Hellenic world;
Xerxes, with a little more competence, might have made Greek
civilization very greatly inferior to what it became after he was
repulsed. Consider the period from Aeschylus to Plato: all that was
done in this time was done by a minority of the population of a few
commercial cities. These cities, as the future showed, had no great
capacity for withstanding foreign conquest, but by an extraordinary
stroke of good fortune their conquerors, Macedonian and Roman, were
Philhellenes, and did not destroy what they conquered, as Xerxes or
Carthage would have done. The fact that we are acquainted with what
was done by the Greeks in an and literature and philosophy and science
is due to the stability introduced by Western conquerors who had the
good sense to admire the civilization which they governed but did
their utmost to preserve.

In certain respects, political and ethical, Alexander and the Romans
were the causes of a better philosophy than any that was professed by
Greeks in their days of freedom. The Stoics, as we have seen, believed
in the brotherhood of man, and did not confine their sympathies to the
Greeks. The long dominion of Rome accustomed men to the idea of a
single civilization under a single government, li'e are aware that
there were important parts of the world which were not subject to Rome
India and China, more especially. But to the Roman it seemed that
outside the Empire there were only more or less barbarian tribes, who
might be conquered whenever it should be worth while to make the
effort. Essentially and in idea, the empire, in the minds of the
Romans, was worldwide. This conception descended to the Church, which
was "Catholic" in spite of Buddhists, Confucians, and (later)
Mohammedans. _Securus judicat orbis terrarum_ is a maxim taken over by
the Church from the later Stoics; it owes its appeal to the apparent
universality of the Roman Empire. Throughout the Middle Ages, after
the time of Charlemagne, the Church and the Holy Roman Empire were
world-wide in idea, although everybody knew that they were not so in
fact. The conception of one human family, one Catholic religion, one
universal culture, and one world-wide State, has haunted men's
thoughts ever since its approximate realization by Rome.

The part played by Rome in enlarging the area of civilization was of
immense importance. Northern Italy, Spain, France, and parts of
western Germany, were civilized as a result of forcible conquest by
the Roman legions. All these regions proved themselves just as capable
of a high level of culture as Rome itself. In the last days of the
Western Empire, Gaul produced men who were at least the equals of
their contemporaries in regions of older civilization. It was owing to
the diffusion of culture by Rome that the barbarians produced only a
temporary eclipse, not a permanent darkness. It may be argued that the
quality of civilization was never again as good as in the Athens of
Pericles; but in a world of war and destruction, quantity is, in the
long run, almost as important as quality, and quantity was due to
Rome.

IV. _The Mohammedans as vehicles of Hellenism_. In the seventh 
century, the disciples of the Prophet conquered Syria, Egypt, and 
North Africa; in the following century, they conquered Spain. 
Their victories were easy, and the fighting was slight. Except 
possibly during the first few years, they were not fanatical; 
Christians and Jews were unmolested so long as they paid the 
tribute. Very soon the Arabs acquired the civilization of the 
Eastern Empire, but with the hopefulness of a rising polity 
instead of the weariness of decline. Their learned men read 
Greek authors in translation, and wrote commentaries. Aristotle's 
reputation is mainly due to them; in antiquity, he was not regarded 
as on a level with Plato. 

It is instructive to consider some of the words that we derive from
Arabic, such as: algebra, alcohol, alchemy, alembic, alkali, azimuth,
zenith. With the exception of "alcohol" which meant, not a drink, but
a substance used in chemistr these words would give a good picture of
some of the things we owe to the Arabs. Algebra had been invented by
the Alexandrian Greeks, but was carried further by the Mohammedans.
"Alchemy," "alembic," "alkali" are words connected with the attempt to
turn base metals into gold, which the Arabs took over from the Greeks,
and in pursuit of which they appealed to Greek philosophy.[^127]
"Azimuth" and "zenith" are astronomical terms, chiefly useful to the
Arabs in connection with astrology.

[^127]: See _Alchemy, Child of Greek Philosophy_, by Arthur John Hopkins, Columbia, 1934. 

The etymological method conceals what we owe to the Arabs 
as regards knowledge of Greek philosophy, because, when it was 
again studied in Europe, the technical term* required were taken 
from Greek or Latin. In philosophy, the Arabs were better as 
commentators than as original thinkers. Their importance, for us, 
is that they, and not the Christians, were the immediate inheritors 
of those parts of the Greek tradition which only the Eastern 
Empire had kept alive. Contact with the Mohammedans, in Spain, 
and to a lesser extent in Sicily, made the West aware of Aristotle; 
also ot Arabic numerals, algebra, and chemistry. It was this 
contact that began the revival of learning in the eleventh century, 
leading to the Scholastic philosophy. It was later, from the 
thirteenth century onward, that the study of Greek enabled men 
to go direct to the works of Plato and Aristotle and other Greek 
writers of antiquity. Rut if the Arabs had not preserved the 
tradition, the men of the Renaissance might not have suspected 
how much was to he gained by the revival of classical learning. 

## Chapter XXX PLOTINUS 

Plotinus (AD 204--70), the founder of Neoplatonism, is the last of the
great philosophers of antiquity. His life is almost coextensive with
one of the most disastrous periods in Roman history. Shortly before
his birth, the army had become conscious of its power, and had adopted
the practice of choosing emperors in return for monetary rewards, and
assassinating them afterwards to give occasion for a renewed sale of
the empire. These preoccupations unfitted the soldiers for the defense
of the frontier, and permitted vigorous incursions of Germans from the
north and Persians from the Hast. War and pestilence diminished the
population of the empire by about a third, while increased taxation
and diminished resources caused financial ruin in even those provinces
to which no hostile forces penetrated. The cities, which had been the
bearers of culture, were especially hard hit; substantial citizens, in
large numbers, fled to escape the tax-collector. It was not till after
the death of Plotinus that order was re-established and the empire
temporarily saved by the vigorous measures of Diocletian and
Constantine.

Of all this there is no mention in the works of Plotinus. He turned
aside from the spectacle of ruin and misery in the actual world, to
contemplate an eternal world ot goodness and beauty. In this he was in
harmony with all the most serious men of his age. To all of them,
Christians and pagans alike, the world of practical affairs seemed to
offer no hope, and only the Other World seemed worthy of allegiance.
To the Christian, the Other World was the Kingdom of Heaven, to be
enjoyed after death; to the Platonist, it was the eternal world of
ideas, the real world as opposed to that of illusory appearance.
Christian theologians combined these points of view, and embodied much
of the philosophy of Plotinus. Dean Inge, in his invaluable book on
Plotinus, rightly emphasizes what Christianity owes to him.
"Platonism," he says, "is part of the vital structure of Christian
theology, with which no other philosophy, I venture to say. can work
without friction/' There is, he says, an "utter impossibility of
excising Platonism from Christianity without tearing Christianity to
pieces." He points out that Saint Augustine speaks of Plato's system
as "the most pure and bright in all philosophy," and of Plotinus as a
man in whom "Plato lived again," and who, if he had lived a little
later, would have "changed a few words and phrases and become
Christian." Saint Thomas Aquinas, according to Dean Inge, "is nearer
to Plotinus than to the real Aristotle."

Plotinus, accordingly, is historically important as an influence in
moulding the Christianity of the Middle Ages and of Catholic theology.
The historian, in speaking of Christianity, has to be careful to
recognize the very great changes that it has undergone, and the
variety of forms that it may assume even at one epoch. The
Christianity of the Synoptic Gospels is almost innocent of
metaphysics. The Christianity of modern America, in this respect, is
like primitive Christianity; Platonism is alien to popular thought and
feeling in the United States, and most American Christians are much
mere concerned with duties here on earth, and with social progress in
the everyday world, than with the transcendental hopes that consoled
men when everything terrestrial inspired despair. I am not speaking of
any change of dogma, but of a difference of emphasis and interest. A
modern Christian, unless he realizes how great this difference is,
will fail to understand the Christianity of the past. We, since our
study is historical, are concerned with the effective beliefs of past
centuries, and as to these it is impossible to disagree with what Dean
Inge says on the influence of Plato and Plotinus.

Plotinus, however, is not only historically important. He represents,
better than any other philosopher, an important type of theory. A
philosophical system may be judged important for various different
kinds of reasons. The first and most obvious is that we think it may
be true. Not many students of philosophy at the present time would
feel this about Plotinus; Dean Inge is, in this respect, a rare
exception. But truth is not the only merit that a mctaphysic can
possess. It may have beauty, and this is certainly to be found in
Plotinus; there are passages that remind one of the later cantos of
Dante's Paradise, and of almost nothing else in literature. Now and
again, his descriptions of the eternal world of glory

> To our high-wrought fantasy present  
> That undisturbed song of pure concent  
> Aye sung before the sapphire-colored throne  
> To Him that sits thereon.  

Again, a philosophy may be important because it expresses well what
men are prone to believe in certain moods or in certain circumstances.
Uncomplicated joy and sorrow is not matter for philosophy, but rather
for the simpler kinds of poetry and music. Only joy and sorrow
accompanied by reflection on the universe generate metaphysical
theories. A man may be a cheerful pessimist or a melancholy optimist.
Perhaps Samuel Butler may serve as an example of the first; Plotinus
is an admirable example of the second. In an age such as that in which
he lived, unhappiness is immediate and pressing, whereas happiness, if
attainable at all, must be sought by reflection upon things that are
remote from the impressions of sense. Such happiness has in it always
an element of strain; it is very unlike the simple happiness of a
child. And since it is not derived from the everyday world, but from
thought and imagination, it demands a power of ignoring or despising
the life of the senses. It is, therefore, not those who enjoy
instinctive happiness who invent the kinds of metaphysical optimism
that depend upon belief in the reality of a super-sensible world.
Among the men who have been unhappy in a mundane sense, but resolutely
determined to find a higher happiness in the world of theory, Plotinus
holds a very high place.

Nor are his purely intellectual merits by any means to be despised. He
has, in many respects, clarified Plato's teaching; he has developed,
with as much consistency as possible, the type of theory advocated by
him in common with many others. His arguments against materialism are
good, and his whole conception of the relation of soul and body is
clearer than that of Plato or Aristotle.

Like Spinoza, he has a certain kind of moral purity and loftiness,
which is very impressive. He is always sincere, never shrill or
censorious, invariably concerned to tell the reader, as simply as he
can, what he believes to be important. Whatever one may think of him
as a theoretical philosopher, it is impossible not to love him as a
man.

The life of Plotinus is known, so far as it is known, through the
biography written by his friend and disciple Porphyry, a Semite whose
real name was Malchus. There are, however, miraculous elements in this
account, which maker it difficult to place a complete reliance upon
its more credible portions. Plotinus considered his spatio-temporal
appearance unimportant, and was loath to talk about the accidents of
his historical existence. He stated, however, that he was born in
Egypt, and it is known that as a young man he studied in Alexandria,
where he lived until the age of thirty-nine, and where his teacher was
Ammonius Saccas, often regarded as the founder of Neoplatonism. He
then joined the expedition of the Emperor Gordian III against the
Persians, with the intention, it is said, of studying the religions of
the East. The Emperor was still a youth, and was murdered by the army,
as was at that time the custom. This occurred during his campaign in
Mesopotamia in AD 244. Plotinus thereupon abandoned his oriental
projects and settled in Rome, where he soon began to teach. Among his
hearers were many influential men, and he was favored by the Emperor
Gallienus.[^128] At one time he formed a project of founding Plato's
Republic in Campania, and building for the purpose a new city to be
called Platonopolis. The Emperor, at first, was favorable, but
ultimately withdrew his permission. It may seem strange that there
should be room for a new city so near Rome, but probably by that time
the region was malarial, as it is now, but had not been earlier. He
wrote nothing until the age of forty-nine; after that, he wrote much.
His works were edited and arranged by Porphyry, who was more
Pythagorean than Plotinus, and caused the Neoplatonist school to
become more supernaturilist than it would have been if it had followed
Plotinns more faithfully.

[^128]: Concerning Gaillienus, Gibbon remarks: "He was a master of several curious but uselsess sciences, a ready orator and an elegant poet, a skillful gardener, and excellent cook, and most contemptible prince. When the great emergiencies of the State required his presence and attention he was engaged in conversation with the philosopher Plotinus, wasting his time in triffling or licentious pleasure, preparing his initiation to the Grecian mysteries, or soliciting a place in the Areopagus of Athens. (chap. x). 

The respect of Plotinus for Plato is very great; Plato is usually
alluded to as "He." In general, the "blessed ancients" are treated
with reverence, but this reverence does not extend to the atomists.
The Stoics and Epicureans, being still active, are controverted, the
Stoics only for their materialism, the Epicureans for every part of
their philosophy. Aristotle plays a larger part than appears, as
borrowings from him are often unacknowledged. One feels the influence
of Parmenides at many points.

The Plato of Plotinus is not so full-blooded as the real Plato. 
The theory of ideas, the mystical doctrines of the Phaedo and of 
Book VI of the _Republic_, and the discussion of love in the Symposium, make up almost the whole of Plato as he appears in the 
Enneads (as the books of Plotinus are called). The political interests, 
the search for definitions of separate virtues, the pleasure in 
mathematics, the dramatic and affectionate appreciation of individuals, and above all the playfulness of Plato, are wholly absent 
from Plotinus. Plato, as Carlyle said, is "very much at his ease 
in Zion"; Plotinus, on the contrary, is always on his best behavior. 

The metaphysics of Plotinus begins with a Holy Trinity: The 
One, Spirit and Soul. These three are not equal, like the Persons 
of the Christian Trinity; the One is supreme, Spirit comes next, 
and Soul last.[^129]

[^129]: Origen, who was a contemporary of Plotinus and had the same teacher in philosophy, taught that the First Person was superior to the Second, and the Second to the Third, agreeing in this with Plotinus. But Origin's view was subsequently declared heretical. 

The One is somewhat shadowy. It is sometimes called God, 
sometimes the Good; it transcends Being, which is the first sequent 
upon the One. We must not attribute predicates to it, but only 
say "It is." (This is reminiscent of Parmenides.) It would be a 
mistake to speak of God as "the All," because God transcends 
the All. God is present through all things. The One can be present 
without any coming: "while it is nowhere, nowhere is it not." 
Although the One is sometimes spoken of as the Good, we are 
also told that it precedes both the Good and the Beautiful.[^130] 
Sometimes, the One appears to resemble Aristotle's God; we are 
told that God has no need of His derivatives, and ignores the 
created world. The One is indefinable, and in regard to it there 
is more truth in silence than in any words whatever. 

[^130]: _Fifth Ennead_, Fifth Tractate, chap. 12. 

We now come to the Second Person, whom Plotinus calls _nous_. It is
always difficult to find an English word to represent _nous_. The
standard dictionary translation is "mind," but this does not have the
correct connotations, particularly when the word is used in a
religious philosophy. If we were to say that Plotinus put mind above
soul, we should give a completely wrong impression. McKenna, the
translator of Plotinus, uses "Intellectual-Principle," but this is
awkward, and does not suggest an object suitable for religious
veneration. Dean Inge uses "Spirit," which is perhaps the best word
available. But it leaves out the intellectual element which was
important in all Greek religious philosophy after Pythagoras.
Mathematics, the world of ideas, and all thought about what is not
sensible, have, for Pythagoras, Plato, and Plotinus, something divine;
they constitute the activity of _nous_, or at least the nearest
approach to its activity that we can conceive. It was this
intellectual element in Plato's religion that led Christians notably
the author of Saint John's Gospel to identify Christ with the Logos.
Logos should be translated "reason" in this connection; this prevents
us from using "reason" as the translation of _nous_. I shall follow
Dean Inge in using "Spirit," but with the proviso that _nous_ has an
intellectual connotation which is absent from "Spirit" as usually
understood. But often I shall use the word _nous_ untranslated.

_Nous_, we are told, is the image of the One; it is engendered 
because the One, in its self-quest, has vision; this seeing is _nous_. 
This is a difficult conception. A Being without parts, Plotinus says, 
may know itself; in this case, the seer and the seen are one. In 
God, who is conceived, as by Plato, on the analogy of the sun, the 
light-giver and what is lit are the same. Pursuing the analogy, _nous_ 
may be considered as the light by which the One sees itself. It is 
possible for us to know the Divine Mind, which we forget through 
self-will. To know the Divine Mind, we must study our own 
toul when it is most god-like: we must put aside the body, and 
the part of the soul that moulded the body, and "sense with 
desires and impulses and every such futility"; what is then left 
is an image of the Divine Intellect. 

"Those divinely possessed and inspired have at least the knowledge
that they hold some greater thing within them, though they cannot tell
what it is; from the movements that stir them and the utterances that
come from them they perceive the power, not themselves, that moves
them: in the same way, it must be, we stand towards the Supreme when
we hold _nous_ pure; we know the Divine Mind within, that which gives
Being and all else of that order: but we know, too, that other, know
that it is none of these, but a nobler principle than anything we know
as Being; fuller and greater; above reason, mind, and feeling;
conferring these powers, not to be confounded with them."[^131]

[^131]: enneads. v, 3, 14 mckenna's translation. 

Thus when we are "divinely possessed and inspired" we see not 
only _nous_, but also the One. When we are thus in contact with the 
Divine, we cannot reason or express the vision in words; this comes 
later. "At the moment of touch there is no power whatever to make 
any affirmation; there is no leisure; reasoning upon the vision is 
for afterwards. We may know we have had the vision when the 
Soul has suddenly taken light. This light is from the Supreme and 
is the Supreme; we may believe in the Presence when, like that 
other God on the call of a certain man, He comes bringing light; 
the light is the proof of the advent. Thus, the Soul unlit remains 
without that vision; lit, it possesses what it sought. And this is 
the true end set before the Soul, to take that light, to see the 
Supreme by the Supreme and not by the light of any other 
principle to see the Supreme which is also the means to the 
vision; for that which illumines the Soul is that which it is to see 
just as it is by the sun's own light that we see the sun. 

> But how is this to be accomplished?  
> Cut away everything.[^132]

[^132]: Enneads, V, 3, 17. 

The experience of "ecstasy" (standing outside one's own body) 
happened frequently to Plotinus: 

> Many times it has happened: Lifted out of the body into myself;
> becoming external to all other things and self-encentered; beholding
> a marvellous beauty; then, more than ever, assured of community with
> the loftiest order; enacting the noblest life, acquiring identity
> with the divine; stationing within It by having attained that
> activity; poised above whatsoever in the Intellectual is less than
> the Supreme: yet, there comes the moment of descent from
> intellection to reasoning, and after that sojourn in the divine, I
> ask myself how it happens that I can now be descending, and how did
> the Soul ever enter into my body, the Soul which even within the
> body, is the high thing it has shown itself to be.[^133]

[^133]: IV, 8, 1.


This brings us to Soul, the third and lowest member of the 
Trinity. Soul, though inferior to _nous_, is the author of all living 
things; it made the sun and moon and stars, and the whole visible 
world. It is the offspring of the Divine Intellect. It is double: 
there is an inner soul, intent on _nous_, and another, which faces 
the external. The latter is associated with a downward movement, 
in which the Soul generates its image, which is Nature and the 
world of sense. The Stoics had identified Nature with God, but 
Plotinus regards it as the lowest sphere, something emanating 
from the Soul when it forgets to look upward towards _nous_. 
This might suggest the Gnostic view that the visible world is evil, 
but Plotinus does not take this view. The visible world is beautiful, 
and is the abode of blessed spirits; it is only less good than the 
intellectual world. In a very interesting controversial discussion 
of the Gnostic view, that the cosmos and its Creator are evil, he 
admits that some parts of Gnostic doctrine, such as the hatred of 
matter, may be due to Plato, but holds that the other parts, which 
do not come from Plato, are untrue. 

His objections to Gnosticism are of two sorts. On the one hand, 
he says that Soul, when it creates the material world, does so from 
memory of the divine, and not because it is fallen; the world of 
sense, he thinks, is as good as a sensible world can be. He feels 
strongly the beauty of things perceived by the senses: 

> Who that truly perceives the harmony of the Intellectual Realm could
> fail, if he has any bent towards music, to answer to the harmony in
> sensible sounds? What geometrician or arithmetician could fail to
> take pleasure in the symmetries, correspondences and principles of
> order observed in visible things? Consider, even, the case of
> pictures: those seeing by the bodily sense the productions of the
> art of painting do not see the one thing in the one only way; they
> are deeply stirred by recognizing in the objects depicted to the
> eyes the presentation of what lies in the idea, and so are called to
> recollection of the truth the very experience out of which Love
> rises. Now, if the sight of Beauty excellently reproduced upon a
> face hurries the mind to that other Sphere, surely no one seeing the
> loveliness lavish in the world of sense this vast orderliness, the
> form which the stars even in their remoteness display, no one could
> be so dull-witted, so immoveable, as not to be carried by all this
> to recollection, and gripped by reverent awe in the thought of all
> this, so great, sprung from that greatness. Not to answer thus could
> only be to have neither fathomed this world nor had any vision of
> that other (II, 9, 16).

There is another reason for rejecting the Gnostic view. The 
Gnostics think that nothing divine is associated with the sun, 
moon, and stars; they were created by an evil spirit. Only the soul 
of man, among things perceived, has any goodness. But Plotinus 
is firmly persuaded that the heavenly bodies are the bodies of 
god-like beings, immeasurably superior to man. According to the 
Gnostics, "their own soul, the soul of the least of mankind, they 
declare deathless, divine; but the entire heavens and the stars 
within the heavens have had no communion with the Immortal 
Principle, though these are far purer and lovelier than their own 
souls" (II, 9, 5). For the view of Plotinus there is authority in 
the Timaeus, and it was adopted by some Christian Fathers, for 
instance, Origen. It is imaginatively attractive; it expresses 
feelings that the heavenly bodies naturally inspire, and makes 
man less lonely in the physical universe. 

There is in the mysticism of Plotinus nothing morose or hostile 
to beauty. But he is the last religious teacher, for many centuries, 
of whom this can be said. Beauty, and all the pleasures associated 
with it, came to be thought to be of the Devil; pagans, as well as 
Christians, came to glorify ugliness and dirt. Julian the Apostate, 
like contemporary orthodox saints, boasted of the populousness 
of liis beard. Of all this, there is nothing in Plotinus. 

Matter is created by Soul, and has no independent reality. 
Every Soul has its hour; when that strikes, it descends, and enters 
the body suitable to it. The motive is not reason, but something 
more analogous to sexual desire. When the soul leaves the body, 
it must enter another body if it has been sinful, for justice requires 
that it should be punished. If, in this life, you have murdered 
your mother, you will, in the next life, be a woman, and be 
murdered by your son (II, 2, 13). Sin must be punished; but the 
punishment happens naturally, through the restless driving of the 
sinner's errors. 

Do we remember this life after we are dead? The answer is perfectly
logical, but not what most modem theologians would say. Memory is
concerned with our life in time, whereas our best and truest life is
in eternity. Therefore, as the soul grows towards eternal life, it mil
remember less and less; friends, children, wife, will be gradually
forgotten; ultimately, we shall know nothing of the things of this
world, but only contemplate the intellectual realm. There will be no
memory of personality, which, in contemplative vision, is unaware of
itself. The soul will become one with _nous_, but not to its own
destruction: _nous_ and the individual soul will be simultaneously two
and one (IV, 4, 2).

In the _Fourth Ennead_, which is on the Soul, one section, the 
Seventh Tractate, is devoted to the discussion of immortality. 

The body, being compound, is clearly not immortal; if, then, 
it is part of us, we are not wholly immortal. But what is the relation 
of the soul to the body? Aristotle (who is not mentioned explicitly) 
said the soul was the form of the body, but Plotinus rejects this 
view, on the ground that the intellectual act would be impossible 
if the soul were any form of body. The Stoics think that the soul 
is material, but the unity of the soul proves that this is impossible. 
Moreover, since matter is passive, it cannot have created itself; 
matter could not exist if soul had not created it, and, if soul did 
not exist, matter would disappear in a twinkling. The soul is 
neither matter nor the form of a material body, but Essence, and 
Essence is eternal. This view is implicit in Plato's argument that 
the soul is immortal because ideas arc eternal; but it is only with 
Plotinus that it becomes explicit. 

How does the soul enter the body from the aloofness of the
intellectual world? The answer is, through appetite. But appetite,
though sometimes ignoble, may be comparatively noble. At best, the
soul "has the desire of elaborating order on the model of what it has
seen in the Intellectual-Principle (_nous_)." That is to say, soul
contemplates the inward realm of essence, and wishes to produce
something, as like it as possible, that can be seen by looking without
instead of looking within like (we might say) a composer who first
imagines his music, and then wishes to hear it performed by an
orchestra.

But this desire of the soul to create has unfortunate results. So 
long as the soul lives in the pure world of essence, it is not separated 
from other souls living in the same world; but as soon as it becomes 
joined to a body, it has the task of governing what is lower than 
itself, and by this task it becomes separate from other souls, which 
have other bodies. Except in a few men at a few moments, the 
soul becomes chained to the body. "The body obscures the truth, 
but there[^134] all stands out clear and separate 11 (IV, 9, 5). 

[^134]: Plotinus habitually uses "There" as a Christian might---as it 
	is used, for instance, in 
	> The life that knows no ending,  
	> The tearless life is There.  
This doctrine, like Plato's, has difficulty in avoiding the view 
that the creation was a mistake. The soul at its best is content 
with _nous_, the world of essence; if it were always at its best, it 
would not create, but only contemplate. It seems that the act of 
creation is to be excused on the ground that the created world, 
in its main lines, is the best that is logically possible; but this is 
a copy of the eternal world, and as such has the beauty that is 
possible to a copy. The most definite statement is in the Tractate 
on the Gnostics (II, 9, 8): 

> To ask why the Soul has created the Kosmos, is to ask why there is a
> Soul and why a Creator creates. The question, also, implies a
> beginning in the eternal and, further, represents creation as the
> act of a changeful Being who turns from this to that.
>
> Those that think so must be instructed if they would but bear with
> correction in the nature of the Supernals, and brought to desist
> from that blasphemy of majestic powers which comes so easily to
> them, where all should be reverent scruple.
>
> Even in the administration of the Universe there is no ground for
> such attack, for it affords manifest proof of the greatness of the

> 
> This All that has emerged into life is no amorphous structure like
> those lesser forms within it which are born night and day out of the

> something of itself.

This is perhaps the best answer to the Gnostics that the principles of
Plotinus make possible. The problem, in slightly different language,
was inherited by Christian theologians; they, also, have found it
difficult to account for the creation without allowing the blasphemous
conclusion that, before it, something was lacking to the Creator.
Indeed, their difficulty is greater than that of Plotinus, for he may
say that the nature of Mind made creation inevitable, whereas, for the
Christian, the world resulted from the untrammelled exercise of God's
free will.

Plotinus has a very vivid sense of a certain kind of abstract 
beauty. In describing the position of Intellect as intermediate 
between the One and Soul, he suddenly bursts out into a passage 
of rare eloquence: 

> The Supreme in its progress could never be borne forward upon some
> soulless vehicle nor even directly upon the Soul: it will be
> heralded by some ineffable beauty: before the Great King in his
> progress there comes first the minor train, thn rank by rank the
> greater and more exalted, closer to the King the kinglier; next his
> own honored company until, last among all these grandeurs, suddenly
> appears the Supreme Monarch himself, and all unless indeed for those
> who have contented themselves with the spectacle before his coming
> and gone away prostrate themselves and hail him (V, 5, 3).

There is a Tractate on Intellectual Beauty, which shows the 
same kind of feeling (V, 8): 

> Assuredly all the gods are august and beautiful in a beauty beyond
> our speech. And what makes them so? Intellect; and especially
> Intellect operating within them (the divine sun and stars) to
> visibility....
>
> To "live at ease" is There; and to these divine beings verity is
> mother and nurse, existence and sustenance; all that is not of
> process but of authentic being they see, and themselves in all; for
> all is transparent, nothing dark, nothing resistant; every being is
> lucid to every other, in breadth and depth; light runs through
> light. And each of them contains all within itself, and at the same
> time sees all in every other, so that everywhere there is all, and
> all is all and each all, and infinite the glory. Each of them is
> great; the small is great; the sun, There, is all the stars; and
> every star, again, is all the stars and sun. While some manner of
> being is dominant in each, all are mirrored in every other.

In addition to the imperfection which the world inevitably 
possesses because it is a copy, there is, for Plotinus as for the 
Christians, the more positive evil that results from sin. Sin is a 
consequence of free will, which Plotinus upholds as against the 
determinists, and, more particularly, the astrologers. He does not 
venture to deny the validity of astrology altogether, but he attempts 
to set bounds to it, so as to make what remains compatible with 
free will. He does the same as regards magic; the sage, he says, is 
exempt from the power of the magician. Porphyry relates that a 
rival philosopher tried to put evil spells on Plotinus, but that 
because of his holiness and wisdom, the spells recoiled on the 
rival. Porphyry, and all the followers of Plotinus, are much more 
superstitious than he is. Superstition, in him, is as slight as was 
possible in that age. 

Let us now endeavor to sum up the merits and defects of the 
doctrine taught by Plotinus, and in the main accepted by Christian 
theology so long as, it remained systematic and intellectual. 

There is, first and foremost, the construction of what Plotinus
believed to be a secure refuge for ideals and hopes, and one,
moreover, which involved both moral and intellectual effort. In the
third century, and in the centuries after the barbarian invasion,
western civilization came near to total destruction. It was fortunate
that, while theology was almost the sole surviving mental activity,
the system that was accepted was not purely superstitious, but
preserved, though sometimes deeply buried, doctrines which embodied
much of the work of Greek intellect and much of the moral devotion
that is common to the Stoics and the Neoplatonists. This made possible
the rise of the scholastic philosophy, and later, with the
Renaissance, the stimulus derived from the renewed study of Plato, and
thence of the other ancients.

On the other hand, the philosophy of Plotinus has the defect of
encouraging men to look within rather than to look without: when we
look within we see _nous_, which is divine, while when we look without
we see the imperfections of the sensible world. This kind of
subjectivity was a gradual growth; it is to be found in the doctrines
of Protagoras, Socrates, and Plato, as well as in the Stoics and
Epicureans. But at first it was only doctrinal, not temperamental; for
a long time it failed to kill scientific curiosity. We saw how
Posidonius, about 100 BC, travelled to Spain and the Atlantic coast of
Africa to study the tides. Gradually, however, subjectivism invaded
men's feelings as well as their doctrines. Science was no longer
cultivated, and only virtue was thought important. Virtue, as
conceived by Plato, involved all that was then possible in the way of
mental achievement; but in later centuries it came to be thought of,
increasingly, as involving only the virtuous wiU, and not a desire to
understand the physical world or improve the world of human
institutions. Christianity, in its ethical doctrines, was not free
from this defect, although in practice belief in the importance of
spreading the Christian faith gave a practicable object for moral
activity, which was no longer confined to the perfecting of self.

Plotinus is both an end and a beginning an end as regards the 
Greeks, a beginning as regards Christendom. To the ancient world, 
weary with centuries of disappointment, exhausted by despair, 
his doctrine might be acceptable, but could not be stimulating. 
To the cruder barbarian world, where superabundant energy 
needed to be restrained and regulated rather than stimulated, 
what could penetrate in his teaching was beneficial, since the 
evil to be combated was not languor but brutality. The work of 
transmitting what could survive of his philosophy was performed 
by the Christian philosophers of the last age of Rome. 

# Book Two CATHOLIC PHILOSOPHY 
# INTRODUCTION

Catholic philosophy, in the sense in which I shall use the term, is
that which dominated European thought from Augustine to the
Renaissance. There have been philosophers, before and after this
period often centuries, who belonged to the same general school.
Before Augustine there were the early Fathers, especially Origen;
after the Renaissance there are many, including, at the present day,
all orthodox Catholic teachers of philosophy, who adhere to some
medieval system, especially that of Thomas Aquinas. But it is only
from Augustine to the Renaissance that the greatest philosophers of
the age are concerned in building up or perfecting the Catholic
synthesis. In the Christian centuries before Augustine, Stoics and
Neoplatonists outshine the Fathers in philosophic ability; after the
Renaissance, none of the outstanding philosophers, even among those
who were orthodox Catholics, were concerned to carry on the Scholastic
or the Augustinian tradition.

The period with which we shall be concerned in this book differs from
earlier and later times not only in philosophy, but in many other
ways. The most notable of these is the power of the Church. The Church
brought philosophic beliefs into a closer relation to social and
political circumstances than they have ever had before or since the
medieval period, which we may reckon from about AD 400 to about
AD 1400. The Church is a social institution built upon a creed, partly
philosophic, partly concerned with sacred history. It achieved power
and wealth by means of its creed. The lay rulers, who were in frequent
conflict with it, were defeated because the great majority' of the
population, including most of the lay rulers themselves, were
profoundly convinced of the truth of the Catholic faith. There were
traditions, Roman and Germanic, against which the Church had to fight.
The Roman tradition was strongest in Italy, especially among lawyers;
the German tradition was strongest in the feudal aristocracy that
arose out of the barbarian conquest. But for many centuries neither of
these traditions proved strong enough to generate a successful
opposition to the Church; and this was largely due to the fact that
they were not embodied in any adequate philosophy.

A history of thought, such as that upon which we are engaged, is
unavoidably one-sided in dealing with the Middle Ages. With very few
exceptions, all the men of this period who contributed to the
intellectual life of their time were churchmen. The laity in the
Middle Ages slowly built up a vigorous political and economic system,
but their activities were in a sense blind. There was in the later
Middle Ages an important lay literature, very different from that of
the Church; in a general history, this literature would demand more
consideration than is called for in a history of philosophic thought.
It is not until we come to Dante that we find a layman writing with
full knowledge of the ecclesiastical philosophy of his time. Until the
fourteenth century, ecclesiastics have a virtual monopoly of
philosophy, and philosophy, accordingly, is written from the
standpoint of the Church. For this reason, medieval thought cannot be
made intelligible without a fairly extensive account of the growth of
ecclesiastical institutions, and especially of the papacy.

The medieval world, as contrasted with the world of antiquity, 
is characterized by various forms of dualism. There is the dualism 
of clergy and laity, the dualism of Latin and Teuton, the dualism 
of the kingdom of God and the kingdoms of this world, the dualism
of the spirit and the flesh. All these are exemplified in the 
dualism of Pope and Emperor. The dualism of Latin and Teuton is
an outcome of the barbarian invasion, but the others have older
sources. The relations of clergy and laity, for the Middle Ages,
were to be modelled on the relations of Samuel and Saul; the
demand for the supremacy of the clergy arose out of the period
of Arian or semi-Arian emperors and kings. The dualism of the 
kingdom of God and the kingdoms of this world is found in the
New Testament, but was systematized in Saint Augustine's _City of
of God_. The dualism of the spirit and the flesh is to be found in
Plato, and was emphasized by the Neoplatonists; it is important
in the teaching of St. Paul; and it domiated the Christian
asceticism of the fourth and fifth centuries. 

Catholic philosophy is divided into two periods by the dark ages,
during which, in Western Europe, intellectual activity was almost
non-existent. From the conversion of Constantine to the deal of
Boethius, the thoughts of Christian philosophers are still dominated
by the Roman Empire, either as an actuality or as a recent memory. The
barbarians, in this period, are regarded merely as a nuisance, not as
an independent part of Christendom. There is still a civilized
community, in which all well-to-do people can read and write, and a
philosopher has to appeal to the laity as well as to the clergy.
Between this period and the dark ages, at the end of the sixth
century, stands Gregory the Great, who regards himself as a subject of
the Byzantine emperor, but is lordly in his attitude to barbarian
kings. After his time, throughout Western Christendom, the separation
of clergy and laity becomes more and more marked. The lay aristicracy
creates the fuedal system, which slighty temperst he prevailing
turbulent anarchy; Christian humility is preached by the clergy, but
practiced only by the lower classes; pagan pride is embodied in the
duel, trial by battle, tournaments, and private revenge, all of which
the Church dislikes but cannot prevent. With great deifficulty,
beginning the the eleventh centeury, the Church succeeds in
emancipating itself from the fuedal aristocracy, and this emancipation
is one of the causes of the emergence of Europe from the dark ages.

The first great period of Catholic philosophy was dominated by St
Augustine, and by Plato among the pagans. The second period culminates
in St Thomas Aquinas, for whom, and for his successors, Aristotle far
outweighs Plato. The dualism of _The City of God_, however, survives
in full force. The Church represents the City of God, and politically
philosophers stand for the interests of the Church. Philosophy was
concerned to defend the faith, and invoked reason to enable it to
argue with those who, like the Mohammedans, did not accept the
validity of the Christian revelation. By this invocation of reason the
philosophers challenged criticism, not merely as theologians, but as
inventors of systems designed to appeal to men of no matter what
creed. In the long run, the appeal to reason was perhaps a mistake,
but in the thirteenth century it seemed highly successful.

The thirteenth-century synthesis, which has an air of completeness and
finality, was destroyed by a variety of causes. Perhaps the most
important of these was the growth of a rich commercial class, first in
Italy, and then elsewhere. The fuedal aristocracy, in the main, had
been ignorant, stupid, and barbaric; the common people had sided with
the Church as superior to the nobles in intelligence, in morality, and
in capacity to combat anarchy. But the new commercial class were as
intelligent as the clergy, as well-informed in mundane matters, more
capable of coping with the nobles, and more acceptable to the urban
lower classes as champions of civic liberty. Democratic tendencies
came to the fore, and after helping the Pope to defeat the Emperor,
set to work to emancipate economic life from ecclesiastical control.

Another cause of the end of the Middle Ages was the rise of strong
national monarchies in France, England, and Spain. Having suppressed
intenal anarchy, and allied themselves with the rich merchants against
the aristocracy, the kings, after the middle of the fifteenth century,
were strong enough to fight the Pope in the national interest.

The papacy, meanwhile, had lost the moral prestige which it had
enjoyed, and on the whole deserved, in the eleventh, twelfth, and
thirteenth centuries. First by subservience to France during the
period when the popes lived at Avignon, then by the Great Schism, they
had unintentionally persuaded the Western world that an unchecked
paper autocracy was neither possible nor desirable. In the fifteenth
century, their position as rulers of Christendom become subordinate,
in practice, to their position as Italian princes, involved in the
complex and unscrupulous game of Italian power politics.

And so the Renaissance and the Reformation disrupted the medieval
synthesis, which has not yet been succeeded by anything so tidy and so
apparently complete. The growth and decay of this synthesis is the
subject of Book II.

The mood of thoughtful men, throughout the whole period, was one of
deep unhappiness in regard to the affairs of this world, only rendered
enurable by the hope of a better world hereafter. This unhappiness was
a reflection of what was happening throughout Western Europe. The
third century was a period of disaster, when the general level of
well-being was sharply lowered. After a lull during the fourth
century, the fifth brought the extinction of the Western Empire and
the establishment of barbarians throughout its former territory. The
cultivated urban rich, upon whom the late Roman civilization depended,
were largely reduced to the condition of destitute refugees; the
remainder took to living on their rural estates. Fresh shocks
continued until about AD 1000, without any sufficient breathing space
to allow of recovery. The wars of Byzantines and Lombards destroyed
most of what remained of the civilization of Italy. The Arabs
conquered most of the territory of the Eastern Empire, established
themselves in Africa and Spain, threatened France, and even, on one
occasion, sacked Rome. The Danes and Normans caused havoc in France
and England, in Sicily and Southern Italy. Life, throughout these
centuries, was precarious and full of hardship. Bad as it was in
reality, gloomy superstitions made it even worse. It was thought that
the great majority even of Christians would go to hell. At every
moment, men felt themselves encompassed by evil spirits, and exposed
to the machinations of sorcerers and witches. No joy of life was
possible, except, in fortunate moments, to those who retained the
thoughtlessness of children. The general misery heightened the
intensity of religious feeling. The life of the good here below was a
pilgrimage to the heavenly city; nothing of value was possible in the
sublunary world except the steadfast virtue that would lead, in the
end, to eternal bliss. The Greeks, in their great days, had found joy
and beauty in the everyday world. Empedocles, apostrophizing his
fellow-citizens, says: "Friends, that inhabit the great city looking
down on the yellow rock of Acragas, up by the citadel, busy in goodly
works, harbor of honor for the stranger, men unskilled in meanness,
all hail." In later times, until the Renaissance, men had no such
simple happiness in the visible world, but turned their hopes to the
unseen. Acragas is replaced in their love by Jerusalem the Golden.
When earthly happiness at last returned, the intensity of longing
for the other world grew gradually less. Men used the same words, but 
with a less profound sincerity.

In the attempt to make the genesis and significance of Catholic 
philosophy intelligible, I have found it necessary to devote more
space to general history than is demanded in connection with either
ancient or modern philosophy. Catholic philosophy is essentially
the philosophy of an institution, namely the Catholic Church;
modern philosophy, even when when it is far from orthodox, is largely
concerned with problems, especially in ethics and political theory,
which are derived from Christian views of the moral law and from the
Catholic doctrines as to the relations of Church and State. In
Graeco-Roma paganism there is no such dual loyalty as the
Christian, from the very beginning, has owed to God and Caesar,
or, in political terms, to Church and State.

The problems raised by this dual loyalty were, for the most part,
worked out in practice before the philosophers supplied the necessary
theory. In this process there were two very distinct stages: one
before the fall of the Western Empire, and one after it. The practice
of a long line of bishops, culminating in St. Ambrose, supplied the
basis for St. Augustine's political philosophy. Then came the
barbarian invasion, followed by a long time of confusion and
increasing ignorance. Between Boethius and St. Anselm, a period of
over five centuries, there is only one eminent philosopher, John the
Scot, and he, as an Irishman, had largely escaped the various
processes that were moulding the rest of the Western world. But this
period, in spite of the absence of philosophers, was not one during
which there was no intellectual development. Chaos raised urgent
practical problems, which were dealt with by means of institutions and
modes of thought that dominated scholastic philosophy, and are, to a
great extent, still important at the present day. These institutions
and modes of thought were not introduced to the world by theorists,
but by practical men in the stress of conflict. The moral reform of
the Church in the eleventh century, which was the immediate prelude to
the scholastic philosophy, was a reaction against the increasing
absorption of the Church into the feudal system. To understand the
scholastics we must understand Hildebrand, and to understand
Hildebrand we must know something of the evils against which he
contended. Nor can we ignore the foundations of the Holy Roman Empire
and its effect upon European thought.

For these reasons, the reader will find in the following pages much
ecclesiastical and political history of which the relevance to the
development of philoosphic thought may not be immediately evident. It
is the more necessary to relate something of this history as the
period concerned is obscure, and is unfamiliar to many who are at home
with both ancient and modern history. Few technical philosophers have
had as much influence on philosphic thought as St. Ambrose,
Charlemagne, and Hildebrand. To relate what is essential concerning
these men and their times is therefore indispenable in any adequate
treatment of the subject.

# Part 1. The Fathers 

## Chapter I THE RELIGIOUS DEVELOPMENT OF THE JEWS 

The Christian religion, as it was handed over by the late Roman Empire
to the barbarians, consisted of three elements: first, certain
philosophical beliefs, derived mainly from Plato and the
Neoplatonists, but also in part from the Stoics; second, a conception
of morals and history derived from the Jews; and third, certain
theories, more especially as to salvation, which were on the whole new
in Christianity, though in part traceable to Orphism, and to kindred
cults of the Near East. The most important Jewish elements in
Christianity appear to me to be the following:

1. A sacred history, beginning with the Creation, leading to a 
consummation in the future, and justifying the ways of God to man.

2. The existence of a small section of mankind whom God
specially loves. For Jews, this section was the Chosen people; for
Christians, the elect.

3. A new conception of "righteousness." THe virtue of almsgiving, for
example, was taken over by Christianity from later Judaism. The
importance attached to baptism might be derived
from Orphism or from oriental paan mystery religions, but 
practical philanthropy, as an element in the Christian conception
of virtue, seems to have come from the Jews.

4. The Law. Christians kept part of the Hebrew Law, for
instance the Decalogue, while they rejected its ceremonial and
ritual parts. But in practice they attached to the Creed much the
same feelings that the Jews attached to the Law. This involved 
the doctrine that correct belief is at least as important as virtuous
action, a doctrine which is essentially Hellenic. What is Jewish in 
origin is the exclusiveness of the elect.

5. The Messiah. The Jews believed that the Messiah would 
bring them temporal prosperity, and victory over their enemies 
here on earth; moreover, he remained in the future. For Christians, 
the Messiah was the historical Jesus, who was also identified with 
the Logos of Greek philosophy; and it was not on earth, but in 
heaven, that the Messiah was to enable his followers to triumph 
over their enemies. 

6. The Kingdom of Heaven. Other-worldliness is a conception which Jews
and Christians, in a sense, share with later Platonism, but it takes,
with them, a much more concrete form than with Greek philosophers. The
Greek doctrine which is to be found in much Christian philosophy, but
not in popular Christianity was that the sensible world, in space and
time, is an illusion, and that, by intellectual and moral discipline,
a man can learn to live in the eternal world, which alone is real. The
Jewish and Christian doctrine, on the other hand, conceived the Other
World as not metaphysically different from this world, but as in the
future, when the virtuous would enjoy everlasting bliss and the wicked
would suffer everlasting torment. This belief embodied revenge
psychology, and was intelligible to all and sundry, as the doctrines
of Greek philosophers were not.

To understand the origin of these beliefs, we must take account 
of certain facts in Jewish history, to which we will now turn our 
attention. 

The early history of the Israelites cannot be confirmed from any
source outside the Old Testament, and it is impossible to know at what
point it ceases to be purely legendary. David and Solomon may be
accepted as kings who probably had a real existence, but at the
earliest points at which we come to something certainly historical
there are already two kingdoms of Israel and Judah.
The first person mentioned in the Old  Testamem of whom there 
is an independent record is Ahab, King of Israel, who is spoken of
in an Assyrian letter of 853 BC. The Assyrians finally conquered
the Northern kingdom in 722 BC, and removed a great part of the 
population. After this time, the kingdom of Judah just survived
the Assyrians, whose power came to an end with the capture
of Nineveh by the Babylonians and Medes in 606 BC. But in 586 BC
Nebudchadrezzar captured Jerusalem, destroyed the Temple, and 
removed a large part of the population to Babylon.
The Babylonian kingdom fell in 538 BC, when Babylon was taken 
by Cyrus, king of the Medes and Persians. Cyrus, in 537 BC, 
issued an edict allowing the Jews to return to Palestine. Many of 
them did so, under the leadership of Nehemiah and Ezra; the
Temple was rebuilt, and Jewish orthodoxy began to be crystallized. 

In the period of the captivity, and for some time before and after
this period, Jewish religion went through a very important
development. Originally, there appears to have been not very much
difference, from a religious point of view, between the Israelites and
surrounding tribes. Yahweh was, at first, only a tribal god who
favored the children of Israel, but it was not denied that there were
other gods, and their worship was habitual.  When the first
Commandment says "Thou shall have none other gods but me," it is
saying something which was an innovation in the time immediately
preceding the captivity. This is made evident by various texts in the
earlier prophets. It was the prophets at this time who first taught
that the worship of heathen gods was sin. To win the victory in the
constant wars of that time, they proclaimed, the favor of Yahweh was
essential; and Yahweh would withdraw his favor if other gods were also
honored.  Jeremiah and Ezekiel, especially, seem to have invented the
idea that all religions except one are false, and that the Lord
punishes idolatry.

Some quotations will illustrate their teachings, and the prevalence of
the heathen practices against which they protested.  "Seest Thou not
what they do in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem?
The children gather wood, and the fathers kindle the fire, and the
women knead their dough, to make cakes to the queen of heaven
[Ishtar], and pour out drink offerings unto other gods, that they may
provoke me to anger."[^135] The Lord is angry about it. "And they have
built the high places of Tophet, which is in the valley of the son of
Hinnom, to burn their sons and their daughters in the fire; which I
commanded them not, neither came it into my heart."[^136]

[^135]: Jeremiah vii, 17-18.
[^136]: _Ibid_. vii, 31.

There is a very interesting passage in Jeremiah in which he denounces
the Jews in Egypt for their idolatry. He himself had lived among them
for a time. The prophet tells the Jewish refugees in Egypt that Yahweh
will destroy them all because their wives have burnt incense to other
gods. But they refuse to listen to him, saying: "We will certainly do
whatsoever thing goeth forth out of our own mouth, to burn incense
unto the queen of heaven, and to pour out drink offerings unto her, as
we have done, we and our fathers, our kings and our princes, in the
cities of Judah, and in the streets of Jerusalem; for then had we
plenty of victuals, and were well, and saw no evil." But Jeremiah
assures them that Yahweh noticed these idolatrous practices, and that
misfortune has come because of them. "Behold, I have sworn by my great
name, saith the Lord, that my name shall no more be named in the mouth
of any man of Judah in all the land of Egypt....  I will watch over
them for evil, and not for good; and all the men of Judah that are in
the land of Egypt shall be consumed by the sword and by the famine,
until there be an end of them."[^137]

[^137]: Jeremiah xliv, ii-end.

Ezekiel is equally shocked by the idolatrous practices of the 
Jews. The Lord in a vision shows him women at the north gate of 
the temple weeping for Tammuz (a Babylonian deity); then He 
shows him "greater abominations," five and twenty men at the 
door of the temple worshipping the sun. The Lord declares: 
"Therefore will I also deal in fury: mine eye shall not spare, 
neither will I have pity: and though they cry in mine ears with a 
loud voice, yet will I not hear them."[^138]

[^138]:  Ezekiel vii, ii-cnd.

The idea that all religions but one are wicked, and that the Lord
punishes idolatry, was apparently invented by these prophets.  The
prophets, on the whole, were fiercely nationalistic, and looked
forward to the day when the Lord would utterly destroy the gentiles.

The captivity was taken to justify the denunciations of the
prophets. If Yahweh was all-powerful, and the Jews were his Chosen
People, their sufferings could only be explained by their
wickedness. The psychology is that of paternal correction: the Jews
are to be purified by punishment. Under the influence of this belief,
they developed, in exile, an orthodoxy much more rigid and much more
nationally exclusive than that which had prevailed while they were
independent. The Jews who remained behind and were not transplanted to
Babylon did not undergo this development to anything like the same
extent. When Ezra and Nehemiah came back to Jerusalem after the
captivity, they were shocked to find that mixed marriages had been
common, and they dissolved all such marriages.[^139]

[^139]: Ezra ix-x, 5.

The Jews were distinguished from the other nations of antiquity by
their stubborn national pride. All the others, when conquered,
acquiesced inwardly as well as outwardly; the Jews alone retained the
belief in their own pre-eminence, and the conviction that their
misfortunes were due to God's anger, because they had failed to
preserve the purity of their faith and ritual. The historical books of
the Old Testament, which were mostly compiled after the captivity,
give a misleading impression, since they suggest that the idolatrous
practices against which the prophets protested were a falling-off from
earlier strictness, whereas in fact the earlier strictness had never
existed. The prophets were innovators to a much greater extent than
appears in the Bible when read unhistorically.

Some things which were afterwards characteristic of Jewish religion
were developed, though in part from previously existing sources,
during the captivity. Owing to the destruction of the Temple, where
alone sacrifices could be offered, the Jewis ritual perforce became
non-sacrificial. Synagogues began at this time, with readings from
such portions of the Scriptures as already existed. The importance of
the Sabbath was first emphasized at this time, and so was circumcism
as the mark of the Jew. As we have already seen, it was only during
the exile that marriage with gentiles came to be forbidden. There was
a growth of every form of exclusiveness, "I am the Lord your God,
which have separated you from other people."[^140] "Ye shall be holy,
for I the Lord your God am holy."[^141] The Law is a product of this
period. It was one of the chief forces in preserving national unity.

[^140]: Leviticus xx, 24.
[^141]: _Ibid._ xix, 2.

What we have as the Book of Isaiah is the work of two different
prophets, one before the exile and one after. The second of these, who
is called by Biblical students Deutero-Isaiah, is the most remarkable
of the prophets. He is the first who reports the Lord as saying "There
is no God but I." He believes in the resurrection of the body, perhaps
as a result of Persian influence. His prophecies of the Messiah were,
later, the chief Old Testament texts used to show that the prophets
foresaw the coming of Christ.

In Christian arguments with both pagans and Jews, these texts from
Deutero-Isaiah played a very important part, and for this reason I
shall quote the most noteworthy of them. All nations are to be
converted in the end: "They shall beat their swords into ploughshares,
and their spears into pruning hooks: national shall not lift up sword
against nation, neither shall they learn war any more" (Is. ii, 4):
"Behold a virgin shall conceive and bear a son, and shall call his
name Immanuel."[^142] (As to this text there was a controversy between
Jews and Christians; the Jews said that the correct translation is "a
young woman shall conceive," but the Christians thought the Jews were
lying.) "The people that walked in darkness have seen a great light;
they that dwell in the land of the shadow of death, upon them hath the
light shined.... For unto us a child is born, unto us a son is given:
and the government shall be upon his shoulder: and his name shall be
called Wonderful, Counsellor, the mighty God, the everlasting Father,
the Prince of Peace."[^143] The most apprantly prophetic of these
passages is the fity-third chapter, which contains the familiar texts:
"He is despised and rejected of men; a man of sorrows and acquainted
with grief.... Surely he hath borne our griefs, and carried our
sorrows.... But he was wounded for our transgressions, he was bruised
for our iniquities: the chastisement of our peace was upon him; and
with his stripes we are healed.... He was oppressed, and he was
afflicted, yet he opened not his mouth: he is brought as a lamb to the
slaughter, and as a sheep before the shearers is dumb, so he openeth
not his mouth." The inclusion of the gentiles in the ultimate
salvation is explicit: "And the gentiles shall come to thy light, and
kings to the brightness of thy rising."[^144]

[^142]: Isaiah vii, 14.
[^143]: _Ibid._, x, 2, 6.
[^144]: _Ibid._, lx, 3.

After Ezra and Nehemiah, the Jews for a while disappear from
history. The Jewish State survived as a theocracy, but its territory
was very small---only the region of ten to fifteen miles around
Jerusalem, according to E. Bevan.[^145] After Alexander, it became a
disputed territory between the Ptolemies and Seleucids. This, however,
seldom involved fighting in actual Jewish territory, and left the
Jews, for a long time, to the free exercise of their religion.

[^145]: _Jerusalem under the High Priests_, p. 12.

Their moral maxims, at this time, are set forth in Ecclesiasticus,
probably written about 200 BC. Until recently, this book was only
known in a Greek version; this is the reason for its being banished to
the Apocrypha. But a Hebrew manuscript has lately been discovered, in
some respects different from the Greek text translated in our version
of the Apocrypha. The morality taught is very mundane. Reputation
among neighbors is highly prized. Honesty is the best policy, because
it is useful to have Yahweh on your side. Almsgiving is
recommended. The only sign of Greek influence is in the praise of
medicine.

Slaves must not be treated too kindly. "Fodder, a wand, and burdens,
are for the ass: and bread, correction, and work, for a
servant. ... Set him to work, as is fit for him: if he be not
obedient, put on more heavy fetters"(xxiii, 24, 28). At the same time,
remember that you have paid a price for him, and that if he runs away
you will lose your money; this sets a limit to profitable severity
(_ibid._, 30, 31). Daughters are a great source of anxiety; apparently
in the writer's day they were much addicted to immorality (xlii,
9--11). He has a low opinion of women: "From garments cometh a moth,
and from women wickedness" (_ibid._, 13).  It is a mistake to be
cheerful with your children; the right course is to "bow down their
neck from their youth" (vii. 23, 24).

Altogether, like the elder Cato, he represents the morality of the
virtuous business man in a very unattractive light.

This tranquil existence of comfortable self-righteousness was rudely
interrupted by the Seleucid king Amiochus IV, who was determined to
hellenize all his dominions. In 175 BC he established a gymnasium in
Jerusalem, and taught young men to wear Greek hats and practice
athletics. In this he was helped by a hellenizing Jew named Jason,
whom he made high priest. The priestly aristocracy had become lax, and
had felt the attraction of Greek civilization; but they were
vehemently opposed by a party called the "Hasidim" (meaning "Holy"),
who were strong among the rural population.[^146] When, in 170 BC,
Antiochus became involved in war with Egypt, the Jews rebelled.
Thereupon Antiochus took the holy vessels from the Temple, and placed
in it the image of the God. He identified Yahweh with Zeus, following
a practice which had been successful every where else.[^147] He
resolved to extirpate the Jewish religion, and to stop circumcision
and the observance of the laws relating to food. To all this Jerusalem
submitted, but outside Jerusalem the Jews resisted with the utmost
stubbornness.

[^146]: From them, probably, developed the sect of the Essenes, whose doctrines seem to have influenced primitive Christianity. Sec Ocasterley and Robinson, _History of Israel_, Vol. II, p. 323 ff. The Pharisees also descended from them. 
[^147]: Some Alexandrian Jews did not object to this identification. See _Letter of Aristeas_, 15, 16. 

The history of this period is told in the First Book of Maccabees.
The first chapter tells how Antiochus decreed that all the inhabitants
of his kingdom should be one people, and abandon their separate
laws. All the heathen obeyed, and many of the Israelites, although the
king commanded that they should profane the sabbath, sacrifice swine's
flesh, and leave their children uncircumcised. All who disobeyed were
to suffer death. Many, nevertheless, resisted. "They put to death
certain women, that had caused their children to be circumcised. And
they hanged the infants about their necks, and rifled their houses,
and slew them that had circumcised them. Howbeit many in Israel were
fully resolved and confirmed in themselves not to eat any unclean
thing. Wherefore they chose rather to die, that they might not be
defiled with meats, and that they might not profane the holy covenant:
so then they died."[^148]

[^148]: I Maccabees i, 60--3.

It was at this time that the doctrine of immortality came to be widely
believed among the Jews. It had been thought that virtue would be
rewarded here on earth; but persecution, which fell upon the most
virtuous, made it evident that this was not the case.  In order to
safeguard divine justice, therefore, it was necessary to believe in
rewards and punishments hereafter. This doctrine was not universally
accepted among the Jews; in the time of Christ, the Sadducees still
rejected it. But by that time they were a small party, and in later
times all Jews believed in immortality.

The revolt against Antiochus was led by Judas Maccabaeus, an able
military commander, who first recaptured Jerusalem (164 BC), and then
embarked upon aggression. Sometimes he killed all the males, sometimes
he circumcised them by force. His brother Jonathan was made high
priest, was allowed to occupy Jerusalem with a garrison, and conquered
part of Samaria, acquiring Joppa and Akra. He negotiated with Rome,
and was successful in securing complete autonomy. His family were high
priests until Herod, and are known as the Hasmonean dynasts.

In enduring and resisting persecution the Jews of this time showed
immense heroism, although in defense of things that do The New
Testament writers are familiar with it; St. Jude considers it to be
actually by Enoch. Early Christian Fathers, for instance Clement of
Alexandria and Tertullian, treated it as canonical, but Jerome and
Augustine rejected it. It fell, consequently, into oblivion, and was
lost until, early in the nineteenth century, three manuscripts of it,
in Ethiopic, were found in Abyssinia. Since then, manuscripts of parts
of it have been found in Greek and Latin versions. It appears to have
been originally written partly in Hebrew, partly in Aramaic. Its
authors were members of the Hasidim, and their successors the
Pharisees. It denounces kings and princes, meaning the Hasmonean
dynasty and the Sadducees. It influenced New Testament doctrine,
particularly as regards the Messiah, Sheol (hell), and demonology.

The book consists mainly of "parables," which are more cosmic 
than those of the New Testament. There are visions of heaven 
and hell, of the Last Judgment, and so on; one is reminded of the 
first two Books of _Paradise Lost_ where the literary quality is good, 
and of Blake's Prophetic Books where it is inferior. 

There is an expansion of Genesis vi, 2, 4, which is curious and
Promethean. The angels taught men metallurgy, and were punished for
revealing "eternal secrets." They were also cannibals. The angels that
had sinned became pagan gods, and their women became sirens; but at
the last, they were punished with everlasting torments.

There are descriptions of heaven and hell which have considerable
literary merit. The Last Judgement is performed by "the Son of Man,
who hath righteousness" and who sits on the throne of His glory. Some
of the gentiles, at the last, will repent and be forgiven; but most
gentiles, and all hellenizing Jews, will suffer eternal damnation, for
the righteous will pray for vengeance, and their prayer will be
granted.

There is a section on astronomy, where we learn that the sun 
and moon have chariots driven by the wind, that the year consists 
of 364 days, that human sin causes the heavenly bodies to depart 
from their courses, and that only the virtuous can know astronomy. 
Falling stars are falling angels, and are punished by the seven 
archangels. 

Next comes sacred history. Up to the Maccabees, this pursues 
the course known from the Bible in its earlier portions, and from 
history in the later parts. Then the author goes on into the future: 
the New Jerusalem, the conversion of the remnant of the gentiles, 
the resurrection of the righteous, and the Messiah. 

There is a great deal about the punishment of sinners and the 
reward of the righteous, who never display an attitude of Christian 
forgiveness towards sinners. "What will ye do, ye sinners, and 
whither will ye flee on that day of judgment, when ye hear the 
voice of the prayer of the righteous?" "Sin has not been sent upon 
the earth, but man of himself has created it." Sins are recorded 
in heaven. "Ye sinners shall be cursed for ever, and ye shall have 
no peace." Sinners may be happy all their lives, and even in 
dying, but their souls descend into Sheol, where they shall suffer 
"darkness and chains and a burning flame." But as for the 
righteous, "I and my Son will be united with them for ever." 

The last words of the book are: "To the faithful he will give 
faithfulness in the habitation of upright paths. And they shall see 
those who were born in darkness led into darkness, while the 
righteous shall be resplendent. And the sinners shall cry aloud 
and see them resplendent, and they indeed will go where days and 
seasons are prescribed for them." 

Jews, like Christians, thought much about sin, but few of them 
thought of themselves as sinners. This was, in the main, a Christian 
innovation, introduced by the parable of the Pharisee and the 
publican, and taucht as a virtue in Christ's denunciations of the 
Scribes and Pharisees. The Christians endeavored to practice 
Christian humility; the Jews, in general, did not. 

There are, however, important exceptions among orthodox Jews 
just before the time of Christ. Take, for instance, "The Testaments 
of the Twelve Patriarchs," written between 109 and 107 BC by 
a Pharisee who admired John Hyrcanus, a high priest of the 
Hasmonean dynasty. This book, in the form in which we have it, 
contains Christian interpolations, but these are all concerned with 
dogma. When they are excised, the ethical teaching remains closely 
similar to that of the Gospels. As the Rev. Dr. R. H. Charles says: 
"The Sermon on the Mount reflects in several instances the spirit 
and even reproduces the very phrases of our text: many passages 
in their Gospels exhibit traces of the same, and St. Paul seems to 
have used the book as a vade mecum" (_op. cit._, pp. 291-2). We 
find in this book such preempts as the following: 

"Love ye one another from the heart; and if a man sin against 
thee, speak peaceably to him, and in thy soul hold not guile; and 
if he repent and confess, forgive him. But if he deny it, do not 
get into a passion with him, lest catching the poison from thee 
he take to swearing, and so then sin doubly.... And if he be 
shameless and persist in wrong-doing, even so forgive him from 
the heart, and leave to God the avenging." 

Dr. Charles is of opinion that Christ must have been acquainted 
with this passage. Again we find: 

"Love the Lord and your neighbor." 

"Love the Lord through all your life, and one another with a 
true heart." 

"I love the Lord; likewise also every man with all my heart." 
These are to be compared with Matthew xxii, 37--39. There is a 
reprobation of all hatred in "The Testaments of the Twelve 
Patriarchs"; for instance: 

"Anger is blindness, and docs not suffer one to see the face of 
any man with truth." 

"Hatred, therefore, is evil; for it constantly mateth with lying." 
The author of this book, as might be expected, holds that not only 
the Jews, but all the gentiles, will be saved. 

Christians have learnt from the Gospels to think ill of Pharisees, yet
the author of this book was a Pharisee, and he taught, as we have
seen, those very ethical maxims which we think of as most distinctive
of Christ's preaching. The explanation, however, is not difficult. In
the first place, he must have been, even in his own day, an
exceptional Pharisee; the more usual doctrine was, no doubt, that of
the Book of Enoch. In the second place, we know that all movements
tend to ossify; who could infer the principles of Jefferson from those
of the Daughters of the American Revolution? In the third place, we
know, as regards the Pharisees in particular, that their devotion to
the Law, as the absolute and final truth, soon put an end to all fresh
and living thought and feeling among them. As Dr. Charles says:

"When Pharisaism, breaking with the ancient ideals of its party,
committed itself to political interests and movements, and
concurrently therewith surrendered itself more and more wholly to the
study of the letter of the Law, it soon ceased to offer scope for the
development of such a lofty system of ethics as the Testaments
[of the Patriarchs] attest, and so the true successors of the early
Hasids and their teaching quitted Judaism and found their natural home
in the bosom of primitive Christianity."

After a period of rule by the High Priests, Mark Antony made 
his friend Herod King of the Jews. Herod was a gay adventurer, 
often on the verge of bankruptcy, accustomed to Roman society, 
and very far removed from Jewish piety. His wife was of the 
family of the high priests, but he was an Idumaean, which alone 
would suffice to make him an object of suspicion to the Jews. He 
was a skillful time-server, and deserted Antony promptly when it 
became evident that Octavius was going to be victorious. However, 
he made strenuous attempts to reconcile the Jews to his rule. He 
rebuilt the Temple, though in a hellenistic style, with rows of 
Corinthian pillars; but he placed over the main gate a large 
golden eagle, thereby infringing the second Commandment. When 
it was rumored that he was dying, the Pharisees pulled down the 
eagle, but he, in revenge, caused a number of them to be put to 
death. He died in 4 BC, and soon after his death the Romans 
abolished the kingship, putting Judea under a procurator. Pontius 
Pilate, who became procurator in AD 26, was tactless, and was 
soon retired. 

In AD 66, the Jews, led by the party of the Zealots, rebelled 
against Rome. They were defeated, and Jerusalem was captured 
in AD 70. The Temple was destroyed, and few Jews were left in 
Judea. 

The Jews of the Dispersion had become important centuries 
before this time. The Jews had been originally an almost wholly 
agricultural people, but they learnt trading from the Babylonians 
during the captivity. Many of them remained in Babylon after the 
time of lizra and Nehemiah, and among these some were very 
rich. After the foundation of Alexandria, great numbers of Jews 
settled in that city; they had a special quarter assigned to them, 
not as a ghetto, but to keep them from danger of pollution by 
contact with gentiles. The Alexandrian Jews became much more 
hellenized than those of Judea, and forgot Hebrew. For this reason 
it became necessary to translate the Old Testament into Greek; 
the result was the Septuagint. The Pentateuch was translated in 
the middle of the third century BC; the other parts somewhat 
later. 

Legends arose about the Septuagint, so called because it was the work
of seventy translators. It was said that each of the seventy
translated the whole independently, and that when the versions were
compared they were found to be identical down to the smallest detail,
having all been divinely inspired. Nevertheless, later scholarship
showed that the Septuagint was gravely defective. The Jews, after the
rise of Christianity, made little use of it, but reverted to reading
the Old Testament in Hebrew. The early Christians, on the contrary,
few of whom knew Hebrew, depended upon the Septuagint, or upon
translations from it into Latin. A better text was produced by the
labors of Origen in the third century, but those who only knew latin
had very defective versions until Jerome, in the fifth century,
produced the Vulgate. This was, at first received with much criticism,
because he had been helped by Jews in establishing the text, and many
Christians thought that Jews had deliberately falsified the prophets
in order that they should not seem to foretell Christ. Gradually,
however, the work of St. Jerome was accepted, and it remains to this
day authoritative in the Catholic Church.

In every important city of antiquity there came to be considerable
colonies of Jews, who shared with the representatives of other Eastern
religions as an influence upon those who were not content either with
scepticism or with the official religions of Grecce and Rome. Many
converts were made to Judaism, not only in the Empire, but also in
South Russia. It was probably to Jewish and semi-Jewish circles that
Christianity first appealed. Orthodox Judaism, however, became more
orthodox and more narrow after the fall of Jerusalem, just as it had
done after the earlier fall due to Nebuchadrezzr. After the first
century, Christianity also crystallized, and the relations of Judaism
and Christianity were wholly hostile and external; as we shall see,
Christianity powerfully stimulated anti-Semitism. Throughout the
Middle Ages, Jews had no part in the culture of Christian countries,
and were too severely persecuted to be able to make contributions to
civilization, beyond supplying capital for the building of cathedrals
and such enterprises. It was only among the Mohammedans, at that
period, that the Jews were treated humanely, and were able to pursue
philosophy and enlightened speculation.

Throughtout the Middle Ages, the Mohammedans were more civilized and
more humane than the Christians. Christians persecuted Jews,
especially at times of religious excitement; the Crusades were
associated with appalling pogroms. In Mohammedan countries, on the
contrary, Jews at most times were not in any way ill
treated. Especially in Moorish Spain, they contributed to learning;
Maimonides (1135--1024), who was born at Cordova, is regarded by some
as the source of much of Spinoza's philosphy. When the Christians
reconquered Spain, it was largely the Jews who transmitted to them the
learning of the Moors. Learned Jews, who knew Hebrew, Greek, and
Arabic, and were acquainted with the philosophy of Aristotle, imparted
their knowledge to less learned schoolmen. They transmitted also less
desirable things, such as alchemy and astrology.

After the Middle Ages, the Jews still contributed largely to
civilization as individuals, but no longer as a race.
